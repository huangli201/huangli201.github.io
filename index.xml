      <description>The next morning, Su Xin woke up early and saw Xin&amp;rsquo;er, who was still asleep, quietly covered her with a quilt.

Staggering out of the door, Su Xin planned to find something to make a sword.

&amp;ldquo;what box?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s it.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;which one?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;the one on the table.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;what box is there on the table except the lamp?&amp;rdquo; Bezebub&amp;rsquo;s face was completely at a loss.
Puzzled, Chen Zhao looked at Beelzebub. &amp;ldquo;are you sure you didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Human, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing there?&amp;rdquo;
He or it, really can&amp;rsquo;t see anything.

      <description>If you want to get a medical license, you need to be familiar with the medical laws and rules on this side of the United States, which is equivalent to a new college entrance examination, which means that, Chen Zhao will not have a stable source of income for a long time to come.
And their own money, certainly not enough to last that long.
So on second thought, Chen Zhao decided to take Ethan&amp;rsquo;s advice.</description>

Seeing Su Xin coming out, the two guild members hurriedly saluted: &amp;ldquo;boss su.</description>

&amp;ldquo;in China, girls who can eat represent happiness.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;but neither East nor West likes fat girls, do they?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I like plump girls, like you.&amp;rdquo;
Greene is a little thick, but not fat, at least in a category acceptable to Chen Zhao.
&amp;ldquo;what are you looking for?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I suspect my pet is sneaking along with me.&amp;rdquo; Chen Zhao said, because Glenn did eat a little too much.</description>

But the manager of Wangji pharmacy think to be longer than others.</description>

Phil checked out, picked up the packed food, and was about to return to the car when he felt stung at his feet.
After two steps, he suddenly felt dizzy, and he reluctantly supported two more steps.
But in the third step, he finally lost his balance.
Phil clenched his teeth, and he had seen that a woman who had been sitting in the corner had stood up and was clearly pulling out her gun.</description>

      <description>Half an hour later, the owners of the casinos, brothels, restaurants and inns in the joyful forest were all gathered in the hall of zuiyue building, bowing their hands to each other to say hello. They all looked bitter.
In their business, it&amp;rsquo;s normal to pay regular money to gangs every month, but have you ever seen it paid three times a month?
At the beginning of this month, jolly forest originally belonged to green bamboo gang.</description>

      <description>All the bosses were thinking in secret, when suddenly came two sneers.
People look up, the voice is still boss Huang.
&amp;ldquo;Boss Su, your idea is really good, but it&amp;rsquo;s a little unrealistic.
Businessmen chase profits, but also to their extreme, if we here according to what you say to do, in advance will indeed attract a lot of customers.
But if the people in changdefang react and follow our example, the advantages of the region are revealed immediately, and we still can&amp;rsquo;t rob others.</description>

Third master tiger took the list given to him by Huang Bingcheng and smiled without saying a word. The middle-aged scribe beside him was holding the folding fan tightly, with a look of horror on his face.
&amp;ldquo;Adviser Li, how about my adopted son?&amp;rdquo; Asked the third master tiger, looking up.
Opening the folding fan fiercely, adviser Li said in a deep voice: &amp;ldquo;ruthless, spicy, thoughtful, the most important thing is to know how to advance and retreat.</description>

      <description>In Changning Province, three gangs, four unions, green bamboo gang and flying eagle gang are the weakest two, and the twogang face is also a close match.
Although green bamboo Gang lost the battle of happy forest, they didn&amp;rsquo;t lose much manpower in fact. It can be said that they actually let the happy forest out on their own initiative.
After all, the previous Happy Forest can really not have any profit, a month at the top of the day to collect 4, 500 taels of monthly money is also good, in order to such a place to fight to the death with Flying Eagle Gang, why?</description>

Walking on the street with Dai Chong&amp;rsquo;s head, Huang Bingcheng felt awkward.
The moment before is still the majestic green bamboo gang big leader, this moment actually was packed in the box, becomes someone&amp;rsquo;s trophy, this kind of feeling lets Huang Bingcheng some inexplicable sigh.
Looking at the front of the stable Su Xin, Huang Bingcheng really can not think of, this boss how to get so much self-confidence.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;because I&amp;rsquo;m from Flying Eagle Gang, that&amp;rsquo;s why I chose to assassinate Dai Chong!&amp;rdquo;
Su Xin looked passionate: &amp;ldquo;Dai rushed to kill my brother, provoking me Flying Eagle Gang, is unpardonable!&amp;rdquo; I Suxin can be where I am today, all by the cultivation of Flying Eagle Gang, humiliating me Flying Eagle Gang, is insulting me Suxin! &amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;then can you consider the consequences of this?&amp;rdquo; Dong Chengwu snorted coldly.
Su Xin patted himself on the chest: &amp;ldquo;my parents died early.</description>

      <description>On the way back, Master Li learned from Third master tiger what had happened in Main Hall, and he could not help but pat his thighs.
Su Xin played this trick, ah, the hard life is to turn the trial meeting against him into a game of fighting for power and profit within the Flying Eagle Gang.
From the beginning, Su Xin did not distinguish for himself, but put himself in a hero position who did not hesitate to fight with green bamboo gang for the sake of his brother.</description>

      <description>Nothing good came out of the two intermediate raffles, and Su Xin lacked some confidence in the third raffle.
But there was nothing technical about this kind of luck, so Su Xin gritted his teeth and took it out for the third time.
The roulette turned slowly and was pleasantly surprised to fall into the kung fu column, this time appearing on the big screen as a young swordsman.
Dressed in a big red robe, tall and beautiful, at first glance, he looked like a handsome young man.</description>

      <description>In hallway&amp;rsquo;s single room, Su Xin sat in a chair drinking tea, and soon Huang Bingcheng came in with Li Huai pushing the door.
&amp;ldquo;Boss.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Boss Su.&amp;rdquo;
That Su boss is Li Huai shout, but let Huang Bingcheng a good surprise.
When he first met this guy, he was very arrogant, and even made it clear that he would not listen to Suxin&amp;rsquo;s orders. How can he shout boss Su now?</description>

      <description>Instruct subordinate helps internal merit,. This is what Su Xin decided yesterday.
His strength is still too weak, although he can kill Dai Chong, but that is only because of the sneak attack assassination reasons, hit Dai Chong a surprise.
If there is another occasion, it is still unknown who wins or loses.
And this time to Main Hall, to see the three Hall Master and unfathomable Gang Master,Su Xin very clear, their current strength compared with them, or too far away.</description>

      <description>After discussing the teaching of subordinate brother martial skill, Su Xin turned around, saw that there was nothing to do, and was ready to go back.
Hallway is guarded, his courtyard is close to Happy Forest, and as soon as something happens, someone will come to report.
Moreover, with the current prestige of Su Xin, it is estimated that few people dare to cause trouble.
Even Third master tiger and Hall Master Dong Chengwu, who are unhappy with him, won&amp;rsquo;t come and mess with him at this time.</description>
