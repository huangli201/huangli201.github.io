  <h2>chapter6 Add another right-hand man</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Chen Zhao was not too surprised. In fact, when he came in, he roughly guessed the situation when he saw the looks of both men and women.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao put on his gloves and grabbed the whole dead Loach. &ldquo;do you feel anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;did you take any medicine beforehand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;do you have the habit of taking medicine? Or are you allergic to some kind of drug? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Asshole, can you do it quickly? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;if you just need me to make it easy for you to make it right away, are you sure you don&rsquo;t need to make sure it works in the future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;all right, man, is there something wrong with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;tell me about your best frequency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;from yesterday to today, I&rsquo;ve been having a party here. About five times, maybe more, and once by hand. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao listened to the man&rsquo;s heart rate again and asked, &ldquo;did you come to me just now because you couldn&rsquo;t get hard when you were flirting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I feel like my mood has arrived, but I just can&rsquo;t get hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need to give you some stitches.&rdquo; In fact, the man has kidney deficiency, and even Chen Zhao, can only hold him up for a while in the future, but not for long, unless he can change the course of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;injection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, acupuncture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;will it hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are very weak now. If you continue to live like this, maybe in less than half a year, you will be sunny forever. Impotence. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. You can help me with the situation first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao opened the box, but the moment he opened it, he was startled. There was a snake in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snake. Why do you have a snake? &quot; The man was also startled and jumped away.</p>
<p>Sizzling-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human? Why did I come to earth? did you summon me? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, this is my pet. Just a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao was also a little confused and mentioned that the colorful snake came out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am subordinate to the king of lust, Raymond. Gala. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, I don&rsquo;t know under what circumstances I summoned you, but since you are subordinate to the king of lust, you should be able to arouse human lust?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you seem to know a lot about demons. Yes, I can do it, but you need to sacrifice me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what do you need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you will find me ten snakes comparable to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you like snakes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I want cao them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, no problem, but can you replace it with this one?&rdquo; Chen Zhao pulls a demon crystal out of his pocket, and Ramon immediately wraps Chen Zhao&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;of course, of course. Thank you for your generosity. You are the greatest, most generous, most selfless human being I have ever seen. It is my honor to know you. You are a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;wait a minute. I accept all the compliments in front of me, not to mention the word &ldquo;good&rdquo;. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t humans think of themselves as good people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;have you come into contact with a lot of humans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are the only one alive, but I have enslaved a few human souls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;so you say I&rsquo;m the greatest, most generous, most selfless human you&rsquo;ve ever seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;is there a problem? You are the only one, so of course you are the greatest, most generous, most selfless human being. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;that makes sense.&rdquo; Chen Zhao nodded, guessing that perhaps he had just seen the occasion along the way, so he had the desire to summon Raymond Sidis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;if you exert your power on him, how long can he last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it depends on your will. If you need it, I will let him die of overwork in seven days, or strengthen his ability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, as long as he stays in a normal state, he can have desire when he should have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao clearly positioned himself as a doctor, not a killer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;it won&rsquo;t last long, six months at the most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it won&rsquo;t take long. I&rsquo;m going to do a long-term deal.&rdquo; Chen Zhao said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;that won&rsquo;t be a problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao thought his acupuncture could relieve the client for a few months and Ramon for a few months.</p>
<p>By the time was over, he would naturally look for himself, and that was right enough to pay him $300.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Chen Zhao returned to his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;where&rsquo;s your snake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The snakehead came out of Chen Zhao&rsquo;s collar, and the man was a little afraid, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t it bite you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ramon, say hello to my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramon slipped out of the collar and climbed down Chen Zhao&rsquo;s arm into the man&rsquo;s hand. The man was still a little scared. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not going to bite, is it?&rdquo; It looks like a venomous snake. &quot;</p>
<p>Ramon rubbed his head against the man&rsquo;s palm and climbed back into his pocket along Chen Zhao&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. Interesting little thing, I&rsquo;m thinking about having one, too. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dale, if you dare to raise it, then we&rsquo;ll break up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman immediately uttered a voice, and the man, Dale, immediately said, &ldquo;all right, honey, I&rsquo;m just saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still advise you not to raise snakes. Snakes have a low IQ and are difficult to tame. Do not see others raise them, especially poisonous snakes. This is very dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;how did you tame it? It looks very clever. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;for the sake of your happy life, I think we should return to the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;all right.&rdquo; Chen Zhao got up and said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;all right? Why don&rsquo;t I feel it? &quot; Dale looked down and found a few needles at the root of his leg and his little brother: &ldquo;Ah.&rdquo; When did you put it on? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll prescribe two pieces of traditional Chinese medicine for you, and you go to the Chinese medicine store to pick up your medicine according to the prescription.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;when will it work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you should be able to pick you up in ten minutes this time, but you&rsquo;d better follow my advice. After all, my method can only last about half a year to eight months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel it, it&rsquo;s hard!&rdquo; Dale cried excitedly, &ldquo;all right, Trilla, let&rsquo;s do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;wait a minute. Could you settle our account first? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you wait, Tella. Let&rsquo;s get started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Dale!&rdquo; Chen Zhao looked at Dale with a black face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;this is my place, yellow. I told you to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao narrowed his eyes and touched Ramon in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;are you sure you want me to wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you. What&rsquo;s going on? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;three hundred dollars. Thank you for your patronage. If you need it next time, you&rsquo;d better have three thousand dollars in cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it to you to stand up at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao patted Dell on the shoulder, and Dell felt motivated again.
