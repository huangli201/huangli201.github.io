  <h2>chapter9 Conjecture about the crystallization of demons</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>&ldquo;Thank you for your patronage. It comes to 23 dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phil checked out, picked up the packed food, and was about to return to the car when he felt stung at his feet.</p>
<p>After two steps, he suddenly felt dizzy, and he reluctantly supported two more steps.</p>
<p>But in the third step, he finally lost his balance.</p>
<p>Phil clenched his teeth, and he had seen that a woman who had been sitting in the corner had stood up and was clearly pulling out her gun.</p>
<p>Phil, who often deals with the police and has been jailed four times, has recognized the woman as a policeman.</p>
<p>With a strong will, he pulled out his gun, and just then a shadow pounced on his wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Phil&rsquo;s gun had fallen to the ground, and before he could pick it up, Green had stepped forward and kicked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greene, he can&rsquo;t move, but I need to give him first aid. The clerk, don&rsquo;t be so nervous. This lady is a policeman, and this man is a wanted man. We have called the police, so we don&rsquo;t bother you to call the police. &quot;</p>
<p>Raymond is a demon, but he is also a venomous snake and carries neurotoxins.</p>
<p>Fortunately, his venom is not very strong, at least weaker than vipers, and the main effect of the toxin is not lethal, but hallucinogenic.</p>
<p>Greene saw that although Phil was poisoned and unconscious, his lower body was unexpectedly high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;this bastard.&rdquo; Without mercy, Glenn kicked Phil in the lower body.</p>
<p>In fact, Greene misunderstood the wanted man, Phil, who was poisoned by Raymond.</p>
<p>Ramon is the subordinate demon of the king of lust, his venom has its own psychedelic effect, and even with the effect of aphrodisiac, so at this moment coma Phil, may not have any beautiful incense dream.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the whole process was smooth, and the smooth Green was a little unbelievable.</p>
<p>A felon who killed three people was so easily arrested.</p>
<p>All this is entirely due to Raymond and Beelzebub, especially Raymond.</p>
<p>Greene has seen well-trained police dogs, the performance is no worse than Bezebub, the difference is only the size.</p>
<p>But she had never seen such a clever pet snake.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe he knows how to make such a complicated instruction that, Chen Zhao really bites whoever he wants it to bite.</p>
<p>When Chen Zhao came up with the plan, Green thought Chen Zhao was crazy.</p>
<p>How could a snake understand such complex instructions?</p>
<p>But it turned out that Raymond could really, and did it very accurately.</p>
<p>It really understands what, Chen Zhao means.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao gave Phil a little blood, at least so he wouldn&rsquo;t die of poisoning.</p>
<p>Although Raymond&rsquo;s toxin is not very strong, it is still possible to die if it is not treated in time.</p>
<p>Greene has handcuffed the unconscious Phil and can wait for the police car and ambulance to arrive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen, I&rsquo;m sorry to ruin this dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. You don&rsquo;t have to apologize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;and thank you, Raymond, the little devil. Chen, do they know what I&rsquo;m talking about? Or do you need any special gestures? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re smart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are no cameras in the restaurant. In fact, the urban camera coverage in the United States is not as high as at home.</p>
<p>Because Phil had just been arrested, there was no dinner and after-dinner show, and Greene needed to go back to the police station in person to record the arrest process.</p>
<p>However, Greene did not say the real client, only to speculate that Phil may have been bitten by a poisonous snake when he entered the restaurant, and then he had to fight with a gun and was bitten on the wrist by Beelzebub without saying Raymond.</p>
<p>After all, if it were said that he was actually set up by a man who controlled the poisonous snake, either everyone thought she was crazy, or Raymond went into the lab.</p>
<p>When Chen Zhao got home, he found that there was a very large piece of demon crystal in the metal box.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao takes a cool breath, which is bigger than the previous demon crystals, and all of them add up.</p>
<p>In front of a few demon crystals, can only use a piece to do the unit, this demon crystal can be used to do the unit, fully half the size of an adult fist.</p>
<p>This must have been the result of catching the fugitive, but catching a fugitive got such a big piece. Is it worth more to catch a bad guy than a doctor to save people?</p>
<p>No, it should not be calculated in this way. It should be that if the person is not caught, it is likely to cause more casualties. That is why such a large piece of money will be rewarded.</p>
<p>At this time, Green called: &ldquo;Chen, thank you so much today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well. Glenn, why are you so polite? I don&rsquo;t think we need to be so polite. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you have to, you don&rsquo;t know, that bastard, he killed far more than three people, and we rescued three girls from the makeshift shelter he confessed. Fortunately, we found them in time, otherwise, they will end up very miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing, actually.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao wondered if this could be something like merit or something like that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just that this thing is called a demon crystal., Chen Zhao takes out the previously small demon crystal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;come here, you two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what do humans do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you call this a demon crystal, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;so does hell have this thing, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but very rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what is the general way to get demon crystals in hell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;how can an ordinary demon get it, even a great demon, at a great price?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;from whom did the great devil buy it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a mine. There&rsquo;s very little in this demon mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;how did the devil mine come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;after the human soul falls into hell, because of their sins, most of them will suffer and suffer, and after decades or hundreds of years, they will dissipate into fragments. The great demon lords will bury these fragments in some special areas, and after a certain number of soul fragments, after hundreds of years, evil mines will be produced, and demon crystals are the associated minerals of evil mines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao thought about it, if this demon crystallization is merit or something.</p>
<p>Well, is it possible to infer that all sinners who fall into hell are sinners, but even sinners may have done some good deeds before they died, so they also accumulated a small amount of merit, which was turned into fragments of the soul after they suffered all their tribulations. And the fragments of the soul still contain their merit, and over time, after the formation of the devil mine, merit is also condensed into demon crystals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;this thing can only be used by demons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;of course!&rdquo; Bezebub and Raymond said in unison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;if anyone tells me that humans can use it, then this demon crystal belongs to whoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two demons looked at each other and neither spoke.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao looked at the two demons, as if they were determined not to tell themselves.
