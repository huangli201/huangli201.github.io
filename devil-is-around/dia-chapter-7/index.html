  <h2>chapter7 I can&#39;t believe you seduced other demons behind me.</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Dale was no longer in a hurry to go to bed and send Chen Zhao off the estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Chen, it was my fault just now. I hope you can come to my manor sometime. My manor will always be so lively. I think my girls welcome you, too. Of course, including Trilla. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I&rsquo;ll come sometime. &quot; Chen Zhao doesn&rsquo;t want to waste his energy here, but the scene of the wine pool is really tempting, and it looks like he should find a regular date first.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao turned on his cell phone and found the policewoman, Green, who he knew yesterday. She was a good target.</p>
<p>Back at the motel, he went to the counter and said, &ldquo;Ethan, this is yours, sixty dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, how did it feel to take the order for the first time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a tough client. The next time he asks me, you&rsquo;ll ask for $3,000 for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re crazy. Three thousand dollars. He&rsquo;s rich, but he&rsquo;ll never accept the price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;believe me, he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Ethan saw Chen Zhao&rsquo;s confidence, he smiled. &ldquo;I was right about you. From the time you saved that girl yesterday, I knew you were no ordinary doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, although I study western medicine, my level of traditional Chinese medicine is not weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s not what I&rsquo;m talking about. The day you look at the girl&rsquo;s soul, drink her back to her body. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see it, but I guessed it. You must be the legendary witch doctor, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Ethan, don&rsquo;t joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kidding. I know people very well. It must be true. That night, the paramedics who came later said it was a miracle that the girl survived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry. Give me two hamburgers, Ethan. Your hamburgers are really delicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;of course, but it&rsquo;s only two dollars a piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;can&rsquo;t you invite me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give you half the price, but I&rsquo;ll give it away for free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;all right, send another bottle of coke.&rdquo; Chen Zhao took out a bottle of coke from the freezer next to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you doctors always preach that carbonated drinks are bad for your health?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;our doctor also said that drinking is bad for our health, but we can still drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Chen Zhao returns to the room, opens the metal box and finds another demon crystal in it, but the demon crystal is very small, probably only the size of a finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;aren&rsquo;t you going back to hell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramon crawls out of Chen Zhao&rsquo;s clothes, but it can&rsquo;t see the metal box, not even it can touch it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human, do you really want me to leave your side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;whatever, the devil I summoned last time, he doesn&rsquo;t like to stay with me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think maybe if I stay with you, I&rsquo;ll get more opportunities to show myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;there are more opportunities for demon crystallization.&rdquo; Chen Zhao skimmed his mouth. He wouldn&rsquo;t believe a demon would like him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, you can stay as long as you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao picked up the hamburger and ate the coke. &ldquo;would you like some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t digested the demon crystals you just gave me, and I&rsquo;m not interested in human food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Beelzebub jumped out of the shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hmm? Bezebub? What are you doing here? Did I summon you? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt the smell of the food and left me one. Wait, wait. You have another demon here? I can&rsquo;t believe you summoned the other demons behind my back! You despicable, despicable human being, how could you do that? I thought I was the only one for you! &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao looked black: &ldquo;if I had a choice, I would like to get rid of you now, never want to summon you again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you. Ah. &quot; Bezebub suddenly had a tail behind him.</p>
<p>Raymond bit mercilessly behind Beelzebub, who jumped up in pain and dragged Raymond around the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, you are the king of lust, subordinate to Ramon! I knew it was these filthy bedbugs that seduced you. It doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ll help you get rid of it. I&rsquo;ll never see it by your side again. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s enough for you to have one of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;subordinate to Beelzebub, you pathetic fat pigs, this is my territory, and now get out of here and leave the world, or I will sterilize you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, both Beelzebub and Raymond are the names of their respective demon kings, not their first names, followed by their surnames.</p>
<p>They have no names of their own, only powerful demons have names.</p>
<p>The two little demons fought back and forth in the room, but there was nothing they could do about each other.</p>
<p>Demons in hell, are territorial consciousness, but this is the world, is the territory of Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>Despite the struggle between the two demons, Chen Zhao tidied up his clothes, because just now, he had an appointment with Glenn.</p>
<p>Greene promised him to come out for dinner tonight, and Raymond climbed to Chen Zhao&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, take me with you. I can help you get that woman to die. I will be your most useful and powerful servant of evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have enough confidence in my abilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;human, take me, no matter what you take her to eat, I can promise to satisfy her, even the dog.. Shit. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao ruthlessly kicked Besib out of the air.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Vincent, as a chauffeur driver for Chen Zhao, came to the motel on time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vincent, go to the Platinum Building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen, do you have a date tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;do you have a condom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a free gift.&rdquo; Vincent took out a box from the box next to the driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;here comes the Platinum Mansion. Have a wonderful evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao and Glenn agreed to meet at the restaurant on the top floor of the Platinum Building, an upscale western restaurant with a slightly dim interior, but close to the window and with a night view of most of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Greene was wearing a low-cut dress, her hair rolled up and her face had some foundation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greene, I&rsquo;m sorry to have kept you waiting. You look beautiful tonight.&rdquo; As a matter of fact, Chen Zhao was going to pick up Glenn, but Greene refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just got here, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would take me at least ten times before you could come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it happens to be free today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao asked Greene to order first, and then he ordered the same one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what department of the police station do you work for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major crimes, all I&rsquo;m in charge of is homicide. The restaurant seems to taste much better than last time, or at least it can afford the price. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao also took a few bites: &ldquo;well, it tastes good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This taste is very ordinary ah, where can I afford the price?</p>
<p>The price on their table is at least two hundred dollars, but it tastes bad at best.</p>
<p>Is it the difference between Eastern and Western tastes?
