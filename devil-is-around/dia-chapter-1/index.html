  <h2>chapter1 I&#39;m here to save the foreign people in dire straits.</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Chen Zhao (zhao) dragged his suitcase out of the airport.</p>
<p>I have heard that foreign people are living in dire straits, and in line with the idea of saving the world, they must come to save them.</p>
<p>At the gate stood two women, one of whom was Chen Zhao&rsquo;s mother and the other was a white woman who was her assistant, as if her name was Sally.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao is an accident doctor, has had medical malpractice in China, has been unable to engage in related work in China.</p>
<p>So her mother brought Chen Zhao to the United States, which is not difficult for the chairman of a pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>Of course, in return, Chen Zhao donates her own bone marrow when her daughter, Chen Zhao&rsquo;s half sister, needs bone marrow.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao&rsquo;s mother and father divorced a long time ago and then went abroad to work, and now Chen Zhao&rsquo;s mother is the boss of a pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>But none of this has much to do with Chen Zhao. The two of them are more like familiar strangers.</p>
<p>Over the years, their connections have been few and far between.</p>
<p>And Chen Zhao&rsquo;s mother helped him more like a deal.</p>
<p>Of course, their relationship is not bad either.</p>
<p>In my early years, it was no one&rsquo;s fault that my parents divorced, just because they didn&rsquo;t fit in, it was that simple.</p>
<p>There is no dislike of the poor and love of the rich, and nothing is forced by reality.</p>
<p>Then Chen Zhao chose to be with his father, it was that simple.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao is not the kind of person who lacks maternal love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;here is your green card and your bank card. There are ten thousand dollars in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Chen Zhao took over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;is there anything else I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no. Call me when she needs it. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao&rsquo;s mother nodded. &ldquo;what business are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. I have my own plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a plan., Chen Zhao doesn&rsquo;t even know where to live right now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going to go back to your old business, you&rsquo;d better get a medical license first. If you practice medicine illegally, you&rsquo;ll be sent back and go to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After saying goodbye to his mother, Chen Zhao hauled into a taxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;where to?&rdquo; The taxi driver is a black man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;help me find a motel, please.&rdquo; The English pronunciation of Chen Zhao is not very standard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Korean? Japanese? Chinese? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chinese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, my name is Vincent. What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God, are you China so dangerous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, something happened to me at home, so I had to flee the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black. Help? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m a doctor.&rdquo; Chen Zhao replied helplessly.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao heard that every black man was talkative, and Vincent proved it well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, can you tell me what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;one of the patients I took over had an operation on him without a letter of exemption from his family. Unfortunately, he died, and then I became the killer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, it&rsquo;s a sad story. Why didn&rsquo;t the family sign a waiver?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao really does not want to discuss this topic, do you want to tell the black man that this is some of the usual medical tricks, let him join himself in denouncing the cold-blooded and ruthless Chinese?</p>
<p>&ldquo;do you have any requirements for accommodation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;the requirements are simple, the environment is good, clean and tidy, the food is delicious, the price is cheap, and there are more beautiful women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, I know a hotel that costs only ten dollars a night.&rdquo; Vincent automatically omitted the other requirements, only understood, cheap.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao was helpless and gladly accepted the motel.</p>
<p>Vincent recommended this motel to Chen Zhao, located on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Surrounded by desolate sand.</p>
<p>It seemed that Vincent knew the owner of the motel, an old fat white man with a big beard, perhaps in a remote location, so there was no business, and the boss was dozing off at the counter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Ethan, I brought you a guest, a lovely Asian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethan slowly opened his eyes. He looked a little slow. He looked at Vincent and then at Chen Zhao:. &ldquo;OK, fifteen dollars a night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Ethan, don&rsquo;t do this. This is my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, if I give you cash, I&rsquo;ll give you ten dollars a night for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao exchanged some cash before he arrived, so he paid briskly for ten nights of accommodation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;do you have any papers? A driver&rsquo;s license is fine. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao took out his green card, checked in, and Ethan took Chen Zhao to a room.</p>
<p>There is no imaginary mess, at least in the Chen Zhao acceptable range, a bathroom and a bedroom, side by the window, so the light is very good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vincent, can you leave a contact information? if I need a car, I&rsquo;ll call you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;of course, I&rsquo;d love to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vincent hugged Chen Zhao,Chen Zhao&rsquo;s overenthusiastic etiquette for America before he left.</p>
<p>But Vincent is a familiar black man, or at least Chen Zhao has a pretty good impression of him.</p>
<p>This is your home.</p>
<p>At the very least, I will live here for a long time to come.</p>
<p>Until you make enough money, or you can&rsquo;t survive.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao took out his salute, and, Chen Zhao was particularly dignified when he took out a metal box.</p>
<p>This metal box was handed down by the Chen family from generation to generation., Chen Zhao&rsquo;s father was a charlatan.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao is curious about how a semi-illiterate father pursues a female student to dominate his mother.</p>
<p>It is said that if you open the metal box, you need to inherit the Chen family business.</p>
<p>But Chen Zhao couldn&rsquo;t open the box, so Chen Zhao was lucky.</p>
<p>After all, even a third-rate doctor is much better than being a charlatan, at least that&rsquo;s what Chen Zhao thinks.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door suddenly opened, standing behind the door Chen Zhao staggered, the metal box in his hand did not hold steady, fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Then the metal box, which had been tried countless times and had not been opened, was opened in this very lax way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t hurt you.&rdquo; Ethan stood outside the door with a hamburger note in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;well. It&rsquo;s all right. Is it for me? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I just came up to see if there was anything you could do for you. I don&rsquo;t think so. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethan&rsquo;s answer made Chen Zhao&rsquo;s hands stiff in mid-air, embarrassed and disappointed, especially when Chen Zhao was hungry.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao closes the door again and picks up the metal box on the floor.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao thought there was something in the metal box, maybe some secret book, or some secret treasure.</p>
<p>But there is nothing in it, nothing, which makes Chen Zhao, who is already very disappointed, even more disappointed.</p>
<p>Twice as much disappointment as not getting food.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao was about to put the metal box back on the table when he suddenly kicked something under his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;where did you get the dog?&rdquo; Chen Zhao found a Shapi dog at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you&rsquo;d better be polite.&rdquo; Shapi turned around and said in a way that Chen Zhao could not understand, &ldquo;I am the lord of hell, Bezebub.&rdquo; Vito. &quot; Ps: bookfriends, I am Hanbao, recommend a free novel App, support novel download, listen to books, zero advertising, a variety of reading modes.
