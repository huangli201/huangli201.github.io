  <h2>chapter8 Enter the state</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I ate a little too much tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;in China, girls who can eat represent happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;but neither East nor West likes fat girls, do they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like plump girls, like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greene is a little thick, but not fat, at least in a category acceptable to Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what are you looking for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect my pet is sneaking along with me.&rdquo; Chen Zhao said, because Glenn did eat a little too much.</p>
<p>Although it is true that Greene is older than the average girl, she will never be able to eat this kind of food.</p>
<p>So Chen Zhao suspects there is something else going on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why. You see, there, there&rsquo;s your little devil. &quot; Greene saw it. &ldquo;what&rsquo;s on its neck?&rdquo; Oh, my God. It&rsquo;s a snake. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;I hope we don&rsquo;t get kicked out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pets are not allowed in such high-end restaurants, but Greene smiled and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m full anyway. Let&rsquo;s go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men reached the door, and the two little demons followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is there a snake on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;this is what I just found today, and then they became friends. Good friend. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s incredible that a dog, a snake, they can be friends. Can it bite people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s good. His name is Ramon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re here, you must make the most of it: &ldquo;Raymond, say hello to Greene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ramon raised his head, stood up high, and then swung his head up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God, it&rsquo;s so smart. How did you do that? This is incredible. A snake is greeting me. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;how did you two get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>, Chen Zhao soon learned that they were secretly in Vincent&rsquo;s car, and when Chen Zhao got on the bus, they got in, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;where are we going next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;how about coming to my place?&rdquo; Chen Zhao glanced at Ramon next to him.</p>
<p>Greene blushed slightly, with an unusual blush on her face. &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men called the car, went straight to the motel, and began a crazy night.</p>
<p>They were both having a good time. Glenn was a very open woman and could accept any action.</p>
<p>Under the gaze of two little demons, the men and women carried out one crusade after another.</p>
<p>Glenn is a good date, and the best thing about her is that she doesn&rsquo;t rely too much on relationships.</p>
<p>They are only stable, and they have made it clear to Chen Zhao in advance that they are not boyfriend and girlfriend, and that both sides can pursue their feelings, and when one of them feels that it can end, they will automatically break off the relationship.</p>
<p>, Chen Zhao is also satisfied with this, and neither of them has an emotional burden.</p>
<p>The next day, Green left, Chen Zhao and was still in bed. He had to say that he still overestimated his abilities so much that he was so crazy last night that he still had a bit of a pain in his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, are you satisfied with my service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t pursue what you two did last night, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you can do anything without my permission. If you use your abilities on me or the people around me next time without my permission, then I don&rsquo;t mind an extra dragon and tiger cooker. You should know that, as Chinese, for cooking innovation, I don&rsquo;t want to create a hundred ways to eat demons in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen, we have another client. I&rsquo;ll send you the address. This time the client promises $1000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao goes to the client&rsquo;s place and finds out she&rsquo;s a Hollywood starlet and she&rsquo;s having sex.. Sick.</p>
<p>She even wanted to use her body as a reward instead of a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Unless Chen Zhao went crazy, she agreed to her request, and in the end she reluctantly paid a thousand dollars.</p>
<p>In the next four days, Chen Zhao received three orders, the highest price is the starlet, the lowest is only $400, the three finally settled, deducting Ethan&rsquo;s cut, nearly $1500.</p>
<p>However, this kind of income, Chen Zhao is still more satisfied.</p>
<p>At the very least, such an income can barely survive in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The premise is that there is no need to go to the Platinum Building every day for a big meal, and Greene is not a vain woman. She eats big food, fast food, and she doesn&rsquo;t have to Chen Zhao to pay for it every time.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao and Green are not tired of being together every day. Both sides have their own life and space, and they both maintain the right distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;where are you going tonight, Chen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a good barbecue restaurant near here, and what pleases me most is that pets are allowed to enter the barbecue restaurant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, I don&rsquo;t need to be here until seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No problem. I&rsquo;ll wait for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike the first time Chen Zhao and Glenn were both dressed up, both wore lighter clothes.</p>
<p>Glenn had just come out of the police station and, Chen Zhao saw Greene&rsquo;s left waist slightly bulging, presumably with a gun.</p>
<p>After the two people are familiar with each other, there is no formality, how to eat and how to drink are more casual.</p>
<p>Greene knows more or less about, Chen Zhao&rsquo;s illegal practice of medicine.</p>
<p>However, the two rarely discuss each other&rsquo;s work in depth, which is also a private space left by both sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;is it really okay for Ramon to eat cooked food like this?&rdquo; Greene looked at Raymond on the table, which was on a bowl, then opened her mouth wide and swallowed a piece of meat.</p>
<p>Greene has seen some TV shows about what snakes look like when they eat, but they have never seen snakes swallow cooked food.</p>
<p>As for the Shapi dog Bezebub is much more normal, of course, his normal is only relative to Ramon.</p>
<p>Bezebub stood on his hind legs in a chair, his upper body lying on the table and eating.</p>
<p>As soon as Green&rsquo;s eyes suddenly closed, Chen Zhao noticed that Green&rsquo;s eyes were looking at his rear, and she was about to turn around. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look back,&rdquo; Green said. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao bowed his head dutifully and continued to eat. he found one of Greene&rsquo;s hands touching his waist, as if he were pulling out a gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;can you explain what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; Asked Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the man who is now at the counter, he is a suspect in twelve robberies and killings, that is, the man who committed the robbery at your motel that day, three people have died at his hands, one of them is a policeman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;are you going to arrest him here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are at least 20 customers in the restaurant, and the suspect is ferocious, he will never be captured, the most likely is to turn into a shootout.</p>
<p>If, Chen Zhao doesn&rsquo;t mind watching a police battle through a TV screen, but in person, it&rsquo;s a pretty bad feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the little devil and Raymond may be able to help a little.&rdquo; Chen Zhao said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what? They? What can they do to help? &quot; Ps: bookfriends, I am Hanbao, recommend a free novel App, support novel download, listen to books, zero advertising, a variety of reading modes.
