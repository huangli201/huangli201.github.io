      <description>Chen Zhao (zhao) dragged his suitcase out of the airport.
I have heard that foreign people are living in dire straits, and in line with the idea of saving the world, they must come to save them.
At the gate stood two women, one of whom was Chen Zhao&amp;rsquo;s mother and the other was a white woman who was her assistant, as if her name was Sally.
Chen Zhao is an accident doctor, has had medical malpractice in China, has been unable to engage in related work in China.</description>

      <description>Chen Zhao mentioned Shapi Dog: &amp;ldquo;it is said that a small number of people will have auditory hallucinations after flying, it should be my auditory hallucinations.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Man, you are insulting a hell lord. Do you understand what this means?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;do you know more than a hundred ways for Chinese to cook dog meat?&amp;rdquo; Chen Zhao is not a pussy at all, mainly because his brain has not turned the corner.</description>

      <description>Chen Zhao looked at the metal box on the table. &amp;ldquo;do you know that box?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;what box?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s it.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;which one?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;the one on the table.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;what box is there on the table except the lamp?&amp;rdquo; Bezebub&amp;rsquo;s face was completely at a loss.
Puzzled, Chen Zhao looked at Beelzebub. &amp;ldquo;are you sure you didn&amp;rsquo;t see anything?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Human, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing there?&amp;rdquo;
He or it, really can&amp;rsquo;t see anything.
Is this the metal box?</description>

      <description>Knock-
At night, Chen Zhao heard a quick knock at the door.
&amp;ldquo;what time is it?&amp;rdquo; Chen Zhao opened his eyes in a daze and saw that it was still dark outside the window.
&amp;ldquo;Chen, did you hear that? I&amp;rsquo;m Ethan. &amp;quot;
Chen Zhao smeared up and kicked something under his feet.
Wang-
&amp;ldquo;Man, you stepped on me.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Why haven&amp;rsquo;t you gone back to hell?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go back yet.</description>

      <description>If you want to get a medical license, you need to be familiar with the medical laws and rules on this side of the United States, which is equivalent to a new college entrance examination, which means that, Chen Zhao will not have a stable source of income for a long time to come.
And their own money, certainly not enough to last that long.
So on second thought, Chen Zhao decided to take Ethan&amp;rsquo;s advice.</description>
