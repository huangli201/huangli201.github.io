  <h2>What I&#39;m better at is the right hand</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Outside the drunk moon building, Su Xin looks at the carved beams and painted rafters,Decorated with gilded, it looks luxurious and incomparable architecture  exclaimed.</p>
<p>Compared with the grottoes of long music block,It&rsquo;s almost like another world here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop! This is already our Flying Eagle Gang Packing Yard.Go elsewhere.Seeing Su Xin entering Drunk Moon Building, a young Flying Eagle Gang gangster quickly stopped him.</p>
<p>Su Xin said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here for Liu Sandao.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boldness! Is the name of third brother what you can call it? &quot;</p>
<p>The gangster shouted, but then his cold sweat came down.</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s ridiculous iron flake sword, I don&rsquo;t know when it has reached his neck!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I go in now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gangster nodded quickly, for fear that Su Xin would  give him a sword seal the throat.</p>
<p>Slowly taking back the sword, Su Xin said quietly: &ldquo;be a low-key person, just a little chief. How can there be so many stinking problems and scare who with such a big show?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Walking into the drunk moon building, Liu Sandao put out a bigger stage than he thought.</p>
<p>After becoming Little Chieftain, Liu Sandao troops gathered six or seventy gangsters, all at Drunk Moon Building, watching Su Xin eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tsk tsk, Liu Sandao, it seems that you are sitting very well in this position, very prestigious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gangster of the Flying Eagle Gang involuntarily looked at Liu Sandao.</p>
<p>He sold out his brother&rsquo;s position in little chief. Everyone has heard about it. Now the bitter Lord has called. They want to see what Liu Sandao will say.</p>
<p>After all, everyone in Jianghu&rsquo;s, and they paid attention to the moral word.</p>
<p>Liu Sandao did it, but it was shameful.</p>
<p>However, people apparently underestimated Liu Sandao&rsquo;s shamelessness.</p>
<p>Faced with Su Xin&rsquo;s pressing questions, he took it for granted: &ldquo;Su Xin,Do n’t blame me, I ’d rather sit here than you,You can&rsquo;t convince people, but I spent more than ten years in Flying Eagle Gang.Countless subordinate brothers.</p>
<p>Besides, for this position, I have planned for so long, but you are going to grab it as soon as you come up, so don&rsquo;t blame me me for my fierce heart! Jianghu&rsquo;s morality? It&rsquo;s just cheating on children!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Dao behind Liu Sandao said lazily, &ldquo;Killing is killing. What are you talking to him about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Chen, otherwise I&rsquo;ll ask subordinate to test him first, then you will come?”Asked Liu Sandao in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Test a fart! If it weren&rsquo;t for your 500 silver tael, it would be shameful for me to take action against a youngster. If you use wheel fights, where do you let me put this face? Do you think I am you Liu Sandao, Can I even lose my face? &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Dao&rsquo;s words made Liu Sandao&rsquo;s face red and white,But he dared not say much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, you must blame me if you die,I just paying someone to solve a problem,Blame your bad luck and run into me. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Dao stands up and moves his hands,Above his pair of iron palms, there was a black luster in the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really? But I feel that you are the only one who is unlucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s mouth showed a hint of smiling expression,But the next moment, his sword was pierced!</p>
<p>The rusty iron flake sword stabbed out at an extremely fast speed and a tricky angle, which made Chen Dao thrilled.</p>
<p>Having seen Old Fifth&rsquo;s injury, he felt that he had learned about Su Xin&rsquo;s strength, but with Su Xin&rsquo;s sword piercing out, Chen Dao knew that he had seriously underestimated Su Xin!</p>
<p>In the head of Life and Death Pass, Chen Dao&rsquo;s intuition for more than ten years of martial arts played a key role.</p>
<p>When Su Xin&rsquo;s sword nearly reached his neck, Chen Dao&rsquo;s right foot suddenly sank down and the cyan stone floor was crushed by stiff, causing his body to lean to the right and the sword edge to cross his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sonorous!&rdquo; One sound, Su Xin&rsquo;s sword body is in Chen Dao&rsquo;s hands</p>
<p>His hands turned black in an instant,Exudes a metallic sheen.</p>
<p>When iron sand palm  arrives at Pinnacle, it can crush the gold crack stone,An iron flake sword can&rsquo;t hurt him yet.</p>
<p>Chen Dao breathed a sigh of relief and a smile appeared on his lips: &ldquo;What a quick and poisonous sword! But your strength is still too&hellip; Uh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped before he finished speaking,Not that he didn&rsquo;t want to say it, but that his throat had been pierced by Su Xin!</p>
<p>Chen Dao had a chopstick in his throat, an ordinary bamboo chopstick,It was su Xin who brought it by hand when he was eating  Steamed Dumplings .</p>
<p>Jin Wuming&rsquo;s sword is a left-handed sword with a sinister angle.</p>
<p>But what he is best at is the right-handed sword!</p>
<p>Su Xin just inserted his chopsticks into Chen Dao&rsquo;s throat with his right hand, and all the people present didn&rsquo;t respond at all.</p>
<p>In your common sense, a sword traveler who deliberately practices a left-handed sword will definitely not practice a right-handed sword again.But Jin Wuming is a special case, so is Su Xin who learned his sword method.</p>
<p>Liu Sandao looked at Su Xin in disbelief.</p>
<p>Chen Dao is dead? Chen Dao, whose strength is far beyond the average Little Chieftain, was killed by Su Xin&rsquo;s two moves?</p>
<p>Looking at Su Xin coming to him, Liu Sandao immediately threw a gangster beside him at Su Xin and turned around and ran.</p>
<p>The gangster was scared mentally stunned, and by the time he reacted, he had been pushed to Su Xin&rsquo;s by Liu Sandao!</p>
<p>Liu Sandao&rsquo;s action made gangster swear in his heart, but he could only watch himself bump into Su Xin, the killing God.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Selling your brother at a critical moment,Liu Sandao, that&rsquo;s exactly what you&rsquo;re good at.</p>
<p>Su Xin stepped out in one step, with amazing speed. In a flash, he passed gangster, threw a sword, and directly nailed Liu Sandao to the ground.</p>
<p>Although there was only a trace of internal force in his body, both strength and speed had increased by more than 10%. Liu Sandao wanted to escape in front of him, it was simply death.</p>
<p>Slowly approaching Liu Sandao, Su Xin pulled out his sword.Turning to the crowd, he said, &ldquo;Liu Sandao is dead,It&rsquo;s up to me now. Who&rsquo;s in favor of it and who&rsquo;s against it?</p>
<p>Looked at by Su Xin, the gangster of Flying Eagle Gang, who was present, had a chilling feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Su Xin! How dare you! Chen Dao is adopted son of Third Master Tiger.Third brother is little chieftain appointed by gang Lord. You dare to kill them in public,Just look at Gang Rules as nothing! You just wait to be punished!&rdquo; A strong man jumped out and scolded Su Xin.</p>
<p>Although he spoke with great righteousness, his legs were still shaking, trying to scare Su Xin with Gang Rules.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Even if the third brother really made a mistake, there are Gang Rules to handle it. When is your turn to Su Xin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you killed the adopted son Chen Dao of the Third Master Tiger, tomorrow you will die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two more people jumped out, and for a while it turned out to be quite generous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Old Boss Sun you guys, it seems that your five brothers really have a close relationship with Liu Sandao,Well, today you go down to accompany him! &quot;</p>
<p>The sword in Su Xin&rsquo;s hand protruded again, and sword glow swept across the throat of Old Boss Sun, splashing a string of blood flowers.</p>
<p>The other two screamed and ran out towards the door.</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s footsteps are light, but the span is huge. It took them only 2 ~ 3 steps to catch up with them, one sword at a time, and all of them were solved.</p>
<p>Now Su Xin killed four of them,The other is Old Fourth, who brought the old Fifth&rsquo;s body to report.</p>
<p>Only then did he dare not stand up to refute Su Xin,Because he had already been frightened by the sword that Su Xin had killed Old Fifth!</p>
<p>Seeing Su Xin&rsquo;s eyes looking at him, old fourth fell to his knees with a plop and cried, &ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s wrong, Lord Su Xin! I really know it&rsquo;s wrong! It was old boss sun and Liu Sandao who decided to sell you,I am really forced helpless ah! Now that they are all dead, you can let me go! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, we should be righteous. If you say so, your four sworn brothers will be very sad. You&rsquo;d better go down and keep company with them. &quot;</p>
<p>Iron flake sword stabbed, Old Fourth could not even cover his throat with his hand.His eyes fell slowly with panic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, is there anyone else against it?”Su Xin pulls back his sword and asks with a light smile expression on his mouth.</p>
<p>More than 60 gangsters shuddered and quickly chorused, &ldquo;pay respects Old Boss Su!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Killing people is not terrible. Their hands are stained with blood,But they are afraid of this crazy energy on Su Xin!</p>
<p>Liu Sandao dared to kill, and Chen Dao, Third Master Tiger adopted son, dared to kill.</p>
<p>He killed old boss sun five brother,Even the Old Fourth who asked for mercy last time,Killing is just like killing a chicken!</p>
<p>In the eyes of these gangsters, this person is simply a lunatic! An unscrupulous lunatic!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dīng dīng! The host succeeded in killing Liu Sandao with 50% Quest completion.Please continue your efforts.&ldquo;System&rsquo;s voice sounded in Su Xin&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Su Xin stunned: &ldquo;I have killed Liu Sandao, even if the gangster present was not convinced by me,Now they take it orally, I can&rsquo;t finish Quest yet?</p>
<p>System said: &ldquo;Quest details are to kill Liu Sandao and become Flying Eagle Gang Little Chieftain,Your current position was obtained through killing and has not been acknowledged by the executives of Flying Eagle Gang.So it&rsquo;s not legal and it doesn&rsquo;t count as completing Quest. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin suddenly had some toothache, this Quest sounds simple, the original difficult place is here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come here, a few people, and clean up the bodies here.&rdquo; Su Xin sits directly in the former position of Liu Sandao.</p>
<p>A gangster quickly stood up and shouted, &ldquo;what are you doing?Didn&rsquo;t you hear old boss Su? I&rsquo;ll take care of the bodies,The bloodstains on the ground clean up for me too! &quot;</p>
<p>This gangster looks like he&rsquo;s about 30 years old, with a stupid look,It was Liu Sandao who threw it out to resist Su Xin&rsquo;s gangster.</p>
<p>Su Xin looked at him with an interested look in her eyes.</p>
<p>He even killed several people by himself, and now these Flying Eagle Gang gangsters are very afraid of him, and only this person dare to come out to please him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name of low person is Huang Bingcheng. To tell you the truth, I have long been tired of Liu Sandao&rsquo;s style. By selling brother, I still put black hand on myself at the critical moment. What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Huang Bingcheng gave Liu Sandao a big bitterness and a deep hatred look.</p>
<p>Su Xin waved casually: &ldquo;Okay,These gangsters will be under your control when I am away. &quot;</p>
<p>Hearing Su Xin&rsquo;s words, Huang Bingcheng immediately felt a joy,He knows he&rsquo;s betting right!</p>
<p>When Liu Sandao was there before, he only trusted those five brothers, the others had no right at all.</p>
<p>Now Su Xin is in power, and there&rsquo;s no one around to help him manage subordinate.He leaned in first, and the other person accepted him.</p>
<p>After packing up the corpses, Huang Bingcheng came up to Su Xin and showed a charming smile: &ldquo;Sir, do you have any more orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much silver did Liu Sandao leave behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is the most needed for being a gangster? There is only one word, and that is money.</p>
<p>He needs money to cultivate himself. He needs money to support his brothers.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng very cautiously replied: &ldquo;One penny is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With such a large Happy Forest, you tell me that Liu Sandao has no money on him?Su Xin coldly&rsquo;s abandonment suddenly made Huang Bingcheng chill all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, really! Liu Sandao, in order to please Chen Dao, gave all the money he collected to Chen Dao to go to the casino. Now he may not even find ten silver taels on him.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng explained with a painful face, and suddenly remembered something. He hurried to say, &ldquo;Yes, adults, Liu Sandao and 500 silver tael.He just collected the shops of Happy Forest and prepared to honor Chen Dao. Shall we keep them or return them to them?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you still have to ask? This money was collected by Liu Sandao, it&rsquo;s not my business? Why should I give them back?&rdquo; Su Xin glanced at Huang Bingcheng. Ask more?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my lord, there is something I don&rsquo;t know should be said or not.&rdquo; Huang Bingcheng suddenly hesitated.</p>
<p>Su Xin waved his hand and motioned Huang Bingcheng to continue.</p>
<p>With Su Xin&rsquo;s permission, Huang Bingcheng slowly said, &ldquo;Your Excellency,It&rsquo;s nothing that you killed Liu Sandao this time.we are in gang .It&rsquo;s not as hypocritical as those sects. To be honest, Strength is respecting.</p>
<p>In particular, Liu Sandao relies on selling his brother, which is morally indefensible. You take action to kill him. Nobody can say anything, but you killed Chen Dao, which caused a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>Chen Dao is the adopted son of our Great Chieftain Third Master Tiger.</p>
<p>Third Master Tiger is over 50 years old this year, and has cultivated Chen Dao for more than 20 years before he has been cultivated to this realm.</p>
<p>Third Master Tiger has no children at his knees, and he wants him to be his successor.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve killed Chen Dao now. I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s very sad for Third Master tiger. &quot;</p>
<p>After listening, Su Xin tapped the table rhythmically with his finger and said, &ldquo;Go and fetch me the details of Third Master Tiger, and change all 500 silver taels into silver tickets for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let&rsquo;s do it .&rdquo; Huang Bingcheng immediately swiftly prepared everything Su Xin wanted.</p>
<p>This is not because of how loyal Huang Bingcheng is.</p>
<p>It is because he has trusted in Su Xin, so naturally he hopes that he can sit in this position. Otherwise, isn&rsquo;t his previous action wasted?</p>
<p>After getting the information, Su Xin read it all in one breath, and his fingers began to knock on the table.</p>
<p>This is a problem developed in his last life,When thinking about something, he would sit alone at the office and knock on the table.</p>
<p>After half a quarter of an hour, Su Xin finally stood up: &ldquo;Go,Follow me to see Third Master Tiger. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&hellip; What!? Would you like to see Third Master tiger? &quot; Huang Bingcheng was almost shocked by Su Xin&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s only half an hour before Su Xin killed Chen Dao, but the third Master Tiger must have known the news.</p>
<p>These gangsters from Liu Sandao subordinate were all newly recruited after he became Little Chieftain.There is no loyalty to him, and so do they to Su Xin, a guy who kills by killing him.</p>
<p>Now Huang Bingcheng can assure you that someone has secretly leaked the news and reported it to Third Master Tiger in anticipation of some reward.</p>
<p>In his opinion, the best way now is for Su Xin to take the 500 silver tael to find other Great Chieftains and dedicate silver to them for asylum.</p>
<p>Now go to Third Master Tiger at this time, the possibility of being big is to be shot dead by him a slap!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t want to go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said Huang Bingcheng, biting his teeth</p>
<p>Anyway, he&rsquo;s standing by Su Xin now. If he doesn&rsquo;t need Third Master Tiger take action again and again, it is estimated that Su Xin can kill him with a sword on the spot.</p>
<p>Other gangsters watched Su Xin and Huang Bingcheng walk out of Drunk Moon Building with cold eyes.It&rsquo;s all an indifferent gesture.</p>
<p>If Su Xin can come back alive from the Third Master Tiger, then that is their Old Boss. If he dies, who knows what he is?</p>
