  <h2>chapter18 Fast sword </h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Li Huai&rsquo;s sudden killing, suddenly let Green Bamboo Gang&rsquo;s those gang members a little in a hurry.</p>
<p>Most of them just have the level of street fighting. How many of them have seen the scene of killing and seeing blood?</p>
<p>Li Huai in the hands of the short sword stabbing, picking, chopping, plucking, ruthless, and stop the gang member to support</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bunch of waste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>See this scene of Dai Chong almost angry vomiting blood, did not expect their own people so useless, so many people together, unexpectedly can not stop each other a person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this boy down first!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are four more people around Dai Chong.</p>
<p>These four Coco are old people who have been with Dai Chong for several years, have killed people in the gang war, have seen blood, and will not be vague.</p>
<p>The four men immediately showed their weapons and killed Su Xin.</p>
<p>Dai Chong&rsquo;s beat drum urn gold hammer is a Dancing, as long as hit, not dead will be seriously injured.</p>
<p>Su Xin picks up the small sword lattice in his hand and quickly blocks the two long knives.</p>
<p>Dai Chong&rsquo;s giant hammer has come, so Su Xin can only step back and kick a gambling table to Dai Chong&rsquo;s body, which is directly smashed by that hammer.</p>
<p>Dai Chong&rsquo;s own strength is equivalent to the begining of HouTian Realm martial arts, and there are four good skills in the gang members, Suxin can only reluctantly resist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy, even the two of you dare to assassinate me. you tired of living!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Think of him to wear vertical and horizontal JiangHu for more than a decade, even sleep take a weapon, two young people dare to assassinate him in broad daylight, it is hilarious.</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s face was expressionless, and although he was struggling to resist it now, he could not see a trace of anxiety on his face.</p>
<p>By this time Li Huai had reached Sox not far away and threw the box containing the heavy sword at Su Xin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;take the sword!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suxin jumped up, the sword that box chop, hold that the epee, even directly toward them wearing red kill.</p>
<p>Su Xin was just suppressed by Dai Chong because the weapon in his hand was not good.</p>
<p>Although the thin sword is sharp, it is too fragile. With the help of four gang members, he dare not fight with Dai Chong.</p>
<p>The drum urn gold hammer weighs more than 100 Jin. If a few hammers come down, his thin sword will be discarded.</p>
<p>Now the heavy sword in the hand, Su Xin&rsquo;s big beard sword style immediately played up, the sword light resembles the traveling dragon general, dense does not have the solution, the heavy huge sword is waved by Su Xin, unexpectedly does not have the slightest gap.</p>
<p>Dai Chong&rsquo;s drum urn gold hammer fell suddenly, but was then flicked away by the heavy sword.</p>
<p>The four gang members is even more unbearable, they have no internal force, nor Dai Chong&rsquo;s natural power, in strength with Su Xin is too far away, easily shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of ghost sword is this</p>
<p>Although Dai Chong did not reach the begining of HouTian Realm, he is also a martial artist who has practiced internal forces. At a glance, he can see that Suxin this sword technique is unusual.</p>
<p>Great Sumeru Sword Style look like clumsy, sword technique complex but put it freely, once on the defensive, even if the strength is stronger than Su Xin strong people, easily can not break, let alone Dai Chong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zheng!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of the golden iron chanting is constantly ringing.</p>
<p>The heavy sword was so powerful that every time it intersected with the drum urn gold hammer, it did not lose the wind at all.</p>
<p>And those four gang members although want lend a hand, but how big beard sword type water does not pour in, with their strength, even let Su Xin dodge the qualification does not have.</p>
<p>When the swords and hammers meet, Su Xin&rsquo;s thin sword in his left hand suddenly sticks out and points to Dai chong dantian.</p>
<p>When the handle of the drum urn gold hammer fell, it was dangerous to block the sword, and there was a cold sweat on his head.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for the sake of convenience, the hammer handle, which was only seven inches long, was lengthened to half a man&rsquo;s height, which blocked the sword, otherwise a sword could be stabbed directly into his Dantian!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left hand sword! What a cruel left sword! &quot;</p>
<p>People who have always dared to use the left-handed sword are the sword walking sideways, strange and ruthless.</p>
<p>In particular, at the last moment, Su Xin used the upright sword technique, with his right hand, but suddenly came up with a ruthless left-handed sword, which was almost defenseless. in particular, Su Xin used the upright Sword with his right hand in the last moment, but suddenly appeared a fierce left-handed sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and call all the people under me. Today we must leave the two of them in yonglefang, regardless of life or death!&rdquo; Dai Chong shouted at the four gang members.</p>
<p>He has now felt the thorny nature of Su Xin. If he is not careful, he can easily lose his own life. What else can he capture alive? Kill it first!</p>
<p>As soon as the four men left, Dai Chong immediately took a defensive position.</p>
<p>The challenge drum urn gold hammer is very powerful and doesn&rsquo;t give Su Xin a chance to sneak in with his left sword.</p>
<p>And Li Huai is in trouble.</p>
<p>Although he is good at martial arts, But He has not cultivated his internal skill. His strength is much worse than that of Su Xin.</p>
<p>Although those Green Bamboo Group gang members fight alone is not his opponent, but a dozen people around Li Huai, do not attack, also do not let him to support Su Xin, for a while also let him helpless.</p>
<p>Dai Chong sneered, &ldquo;now put down the sword in his hand and tell me who is the one who ordered you to kill me. I can spare your life, or you will know the consequences when all my men come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember flying eagle gang members killed by your green bamboo gang yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dai Chong&rsquo;s face suddenly showed an incredible look: &ldquo;are you from Flying Eagle Gang?&rdquo; No way! Flying Eagle Gang will never have another fight with me at this time, and you are no less powerful than the big leader, but I have never seen you in Flying Eagle Gang! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zheng!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s left-handed sword suddenly stabbed, but it was still blocked by Dai Chong.</p>
<p>Although his sword is fast, Dai Chong not slow</p>
<p>Besides, Dai Chong knows that Su Xin&rsquo;s left sword is strange and cruel. He is always on guard against Su Xin&rsquo;s move. Even if he just spoke, his eyes did not leave Su Xin&rsquo;s left hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;want to take the opportunity to sneak attack? You&rsquo;re too young! &quot;</p>
<p>Dai Chong sneers, but his smile hasn&rsquo;t disappeared. The huge sword of Su Xin&rsquo;s right hand has pierced his abdomen. Its speed is even three points faster than that of the thin sword!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never said that I&rsquo;m good at left-handed swords.&rdquo; Su Xin said softly.</p>
<p>Jing Wuming&rsquo;s sword is famous for its ferocity, acrimony and treachery. Since his debut, he has used his left sword.</p>
<p>But in the sound of the knife in the Border Town, Jing Wu once said that after his left hand was broken, everyone thought he had become a loser, but those people died under his right-handed sword!</p>
<p>Jing Wu&rsquo;s sword, the right hand is stronger than the left hand, this month, Su Xin has been practicing, but also the right hand sword!</p>
<p>Dai Chong eyes with unwilling color, but the heavy sword pierced into the body, brought out the wound is the size of a slap, the passage of a large amount of blood has made him unable to lift a trace of strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;one last thing to tell you, I&rsquo;m really from Flying Eagle Gang, just to avenge the gang members who was killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wave of a thin sword in his left hand, Dai Chong&rsquo;s head was already carried by Su Xin in his hand!</p>
<p>Green bamboo group gang members, who were still fighting with Li Huai, suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Boss people have been killed, which also make fight?</p>
<p>Without talk, these gang members turned and ran.</p>
<p>Dai Chong is just their boss, not their real father. The bosses are all dead. Why do they bother to fight the villains like Su Xin?</p>
<p>A group of people left Suxin and didn&rsquo;t catch up, but suddenly stopped a man and asked smilingly, &ldquo;Zhang Hong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man stopped by Su Xin is Zhang Hong who killed his subordinates.</p>
<p>Just when the war began, this guy went so far as to hide directly to one side, originally in the mind of sneaking attack.</p>
<p>But now, seeing that Dai Chong was killed by Su Xin, and listening to Su Xin&rsquo;s revenge for the dead gang members, he was scared out of his wits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not me!&rdquo; Zhang Honglian hurriedly waved his hand and looked very white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s not you.&rdquo; Su Xin smiled and waved.</p>
<p>Zhang Hong turns around and runs like Amnesty, but the next moment, his head has already appeared in Su Xin&rsquo;s hand!</p>
<p>Casually found a tablecloth to wrap up the two heads, he saw Li Huai complexion some complex come over, ten thousand years unchanged dead face, unexpectedly has the tangled appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss Su, I was wrong about you.&rdquo; Li Huai struggled to utter this sentence.</p>
<p>Li Huai said nothing, but Su Xin knew what he meant, referring to what he had said at the door of the Third master tiger house.</p>
<p>In fact, Su Xin did not take Li Huai&rsquo;s words to heart. Through Huang Bingcheng&rsquo;s information and contact with Li Huai, he has almost guessed what kind of character Li Huai is.</p>
<p>He has a bad temper, but he only respects those who are better than himself.</p>
<p>The third master tiger is better than him, so he is willing to be a thug under the third master tiger. He doesn&rsquo;t ask for power, but only for the chance to fight.</p>
<p>Ji Gang is not as strong as him. Even though Ji Gang has the same identity as him, Li Huai doesn&rsquo;t put Ji Gang in his eyes.</p>
<p>The same is true of Suxin before. Even though he is a kid of Third Master tiger and a small leader of flying eagle Gang, it is still no big deal for Li Huai.</p>
<p>It was not until now that he saw the strength of Suxin that he really regarded him as his boss, and it was not until now that he was qualified to call him &lsquo;boss Su&rsquo; by Li Huai.</p>
<p>Su Xin patted him on the shoulder: &ldquo;you said you  wrong before, but now you can  right.&quot;. Let&rsquo;s go. We can&rsquo;t leave until the green bamboo gang arrives. &quot;</p>
<p>As the leader of Green Bamboo Group, Dai Chong had no one thousand or eight hundred people in Yongle Square. Even if the two of them were brave enough to be surrounded by so many people, there would be no life or death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I also hope I didn&rsquo;t mistake you. With the third master tiger, I haven&rsquo;t seen blood for a long time.&rdquo; Li Huai&rsquo;s eyes were ablaze with excitement, as if only sword and blood could interest him.</p>
<p>Su Xin walked out of the casino with his head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, there are a lot of opportunities like this with me. You can hold on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Su Xin is also interested in Li Huai.</p>
<p>A man who is only interested in swords and killings does not know how he developed this character.</p>
<p>People like Li Huai should not stay in the middle of the little gang, but it is appropriate to join the army on the front line.</p>
<p>The two men walked out and waited for half a quarter of an hour before the green bamboo gang team arrived.</p>
<p>All that awaits them is two headless bodies.</p>
