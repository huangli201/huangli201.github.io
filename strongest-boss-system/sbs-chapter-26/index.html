  <h2>The sadness of the people at the bottom</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>After discussing the teaching of subordinate brother martial skill, Su Xin turned around, saw that there was nothing to do, and was ready to go back.</p>
<p>Hallway is guarded, his courtyard is close to Happy Forest, and as soon as something happens, someone will come to report.</p>
<p>Moreover, with the current prestige of Su Xin, it is estimated that few people dare to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Even Third master tiger and Hall Master Dong Chengwu, who are unhappy with him, won&rsquo;t come and mess with him at this time.</p>
<p>It was almost noon when, Su Xin bought a catty of beef sauce and a lotus leaf chicken on his way back.</p>
<p>There are still two guards at the gate of the courtyard.</p>
<p>In fact, after the great increase in the strength of Su Xin, they want them to withdraw, but considering that there is still Xin&rsquo;er at home, they just do it.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s offended a lot of people now, and although disaster falls upon family, is on the defensive in case he encounters that kind of madness.</p>
<p>When they saw Su Xin coming back, the two helpers immediately said respectfully, &ldquo;Old Boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin threw out a silver tael:. &ldquo;thanks for your hard work. Go for a lunch and have a drink at noon and have a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two helpers took over the silver, stirred up and said, &ldquo;Thank you, Old Boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re not because Su Xin rewarded a silver tael and stirred up, because they felt something in Su Xin&rsquo;s &lsquo;s behavior, which is called respect.</p>
<p>Push open the door, Xin&rsquo;er with Su Xin to cut his little wooden sword dance is a tiger breeze, decent.</p>
<p>When Su Xin saw this, he remembered, and it was time for Xin&rsquo;er to practice internal merit.</p>
<p>Although Xin&rsquo;er is young, but in martial skill&rsquo;s understanding is very talented, at least Great Sumeru Sword Style this complicated swordsmanship Su Xin only taught her a few times, she can learn decent.</p>
<p>This talent is better than Su Xin, and I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll learn internal merit soon.</p>
<p>Su Xin did not want to cultivate Xin&rsquo;er into what Jianghu Heroic Female, has her own protection in his life, if there is any harm to Xin&rsquo;er, then he elder brother directly to commit suicide.</p>
<p>But even if you don&rsquo;t fight, you have to cultivate internal merit, as he told Huang Bingcheng, it&rsquo;s good to be fit.</p>
<p>And Xin&rsquo;er &lsquo;s character is also more suitable for cultivate internal merit, to withstand loneliness, happy quiet do not like moving.</p>
<p>Although she is still young, she does not like to run around as much as her peers do. Instead, give her something, and she can play quietly all day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;elder brother, why are you back so early today?&rdquo; When he saw Su Xin coming back, Xin&rsquo;er immediately dropped wooden sword and trotted over and picked up the sauced beef in his hand with the lotus leaf chicken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I miss our Xin&rsquo;er, of course.&rdquo; Su Xin rubbed Xin&rsquo;er &lsquo;s little head. &ldquo;wash your hands and get ready for dinner. Cut the sauced beef. Remember not to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xin&rsquo;er trotted into the kitchen to cut the sauced beef and forgot about Su Xin telling her to wash her hands first.</p>
<p>After eating, Su Xin took out the paper and copied a copy of &ldquo;Quanzhen Religion Primary Level Internal Merit&rdquo; to Xin&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>His book from System gave it to Li Huai, and didn&rsquo;t ask him to copy it. Just read it to everyone when you teach internal merit.</p>
<p>He subordinate those people are mostly from Long Music Block local background, all grew up in the slums, how many can read? It&rsquo;s no use copying it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er, come here and teach you something new today. Remember to learn hard. You can&rsquo;t be lazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shove merit law into Xin&rsquo;er &lsquo;s hand and, Su Xin says, &ldquo;memorize merit law first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xin&rsquo;er struggled with his little face and said, &ldquo;Big.&rdquo; At the beginning of the day. Tongjiu. &quot;</p>
<p>A paragraph was stumbled by her reading, three words were two wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know any of these words Xin&rsquo;er?&rdquo; Su Xin asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Xin&rsquo;er pouted his grievance: &ldquo;my mother only taught me to read for a year before she died. I&rsquo;ve forgotten about it a long time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result of the fusion of memories between the two generations, something in Su Xin was buried in the deepest part of his memory. Xin&rsquo;er remembered that Xin&rsquo;er had indeed not studied much.</p>
<p>I remember when he was a child, his mother began to teach himself to read, so even if Su Xin grew up in the grottoes, he could write a good font, and he could dabble in poetry, classics and so on.</p>
<p>When Xin&rsquo;er was young, her mother personally also taught her, but at that time Xin&rsquo;er was only four or five years old, and his mother only taught Xin&rsquo;er to die in less than a year. Coupled with the fact that Xin&rsquo;er was still young at that time, she estimated that what she had learned had long been forgotten in the back of his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, I think you listen to, Grand Dao first repair nine orifices, Jiuqiao original in the tail point, first rushed from the foot of Yongquan, Yongquan rushed to the knee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After reading a short heart law to Xin&rsquo;er, the little girl was drowsy, and she was obviously interested in this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Su Xin nodded her little head. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be lazy. I&rsquo;ll hire you a gentleman tomorrow. I&rsquo;ll let you read first, and then you&rsquo;ll memorize heart law to me yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! Xin&rsquo;er, don&rsquo;t read! &quot;</p>
<p>Xin&rsquo;er immediately suffered a small face to refuse, big eyes misty, a look of grievance.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s annoying to study every day. It&rsquo;s still fun to practice swords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s no use pretending to be pathetic. I don&rsquo;t want to make you a lady, but at least I have to be literate.&rdquo; Su Xin waved his hand, which was clearly not negotiable.</p>
<p>Xin&rsquo;er, who protested for a long time without results, had to admit it with a small face, 100 reluctantly in his heart.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Su Xin asked Huang Bingcheng to gather all his subordinate brothers in hallway,.</p>
<p>After more than a month of development, he has 190 people in subordinate, nearly three times more than when he first took over Happy Forest.</p>
<p>Because Su Xin is famous in Flying Eagle Gang, not only Long Music Block locals, but also people in Flying Eagle Gang want to transfer to his subordinate,. Of course, the monthly money of ten silver tael is the most important.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng has a good eye for people. These 190 people are picky and slippery, and they want to stay after the sophisticate, which is full of money, which is basically trustworthy.</p>
<p>The Happy Forest is small, and only 1/3 of the nearly 200 people normally patrol the Happy Forest, while the rest either rest or exercise in the hallway backyard.</p>
<p>This time we called everyone together, and needless to say, the helpers knew that something big was going to happen.</p>
<p>Su Xin took Li Huai and Huang Bingcheng out of the backyard and saw Old Boss coming. People looked up one after another, and some youngster eyes showed reverence.</p>
<p>Most of these youngster came out of the grottoes of Long Music Block, and there is only one reason to join Flying Eagle Gang, and that is to make ends meet.</p>
<p>However, after seeing the deeds of Su Xin&rsquo;s, this kind of muddling psychology suddenly turned into worship.</p>
<p>The same poor boy who came out of the Long Music Block, it took only more than a month for, Su Xin to change from a small gang at the lowest level to a Old Boss on the side of the guard.</p>
<p>The appeal of this legend to these youngster biggest.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the crowd, Su Xin shouted, &ldquo;before I talk about it, let me ask you a question. Why did you join Flying Eagle Gang?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you know, once into Jianghu is like the sea, even if we Flying Eagle Gang is just a small gang in Changning Province, but this is Jianghu,Life and Death can not help it!</p>
<p>One moment you may still be drinking with brother, and the next you will be exposed to the streets and become a stepping stone to the rest of the fight! &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s &lsquo;s voice fell, and there was some riot among the people present. I don&rsquo;t know what Old Boss means.</p>
<p>Those new to Flying Eagle Gang youngster may not understand, but a few Flying Eagle Gang elderly is sighing.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people are buried in mass graves outside the city every year.</p>
<p>Of these hundreds of people, there are few ordinary people, but most of them are members of these gangs, the lowest &lsquo;Jianghu&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;have you figured it out? You tell me first. &quot; Su Xin ordered someone.</p>
<p>The man Su Xin looked familiar, and it was the brother, of Chen San, who was killed by green bamboo gang, whose name was Li Qing.</p>
<p>He and the dead Chen San were also newcomers to Flying Eagle Gang, but the Li Qing impressed Su Xin&rsquo;s. He was a bloody, righteous man, but not reckless and sensible.</p>
<p>Was pointed out by Su Xin, Li Qing stupefied, and then smiled: &ldquo;Old Boss, I said vulgar, you can not be offended, I joined the gang for the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father and my mother went early. I was exhausted in order to raise me in this life. I didn&rsquo;t see me ask for a daughter-in-law until I died.</p>
<p>I Li Qing also do not strive for glory, every day in the East side to give people anti-big bag, a talent to earn ten big money, but also by the teeth to take away the two.</p>
<p>If you get mixed up like this, let alone ask for a daughter-in-law, it would be nice to be able to barely starve to death.</p>
<p>So I am not reconciled, want to take advantage of young and two | tael handle strength to be a blogger!</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t die in a few years, save some money for your wife, or at least save a seed for my Old Li family, or else I Li Qing won&rsquo;t be able to go down and see my parents even if I die! &quot;</p>
<p>After Li Qing said this, the crowd present were silent and did not feel good in their hearts, especially those who also came out of Long Music Block., Li Qing simply spoke their minds.</p>
<p>In the early years, Changning Province was still prosperous as a Great Zhou Capital, but since Great Zhou Dynasty moved to the capital, the Changning Province has been getting worse and worse year after year.</p>
<p>Changning Province is in the land of Xiangnan, near southern barbarian, land is not barren, but how high land and forest, itself is not suitable for growing crops.</p>
<p>Originally, because it is Capital, it is commercially developed, but after moving the capital, even the merchants have lost the only advantage of, Changning Province, and the only advantage is that they are close to southern barbarian, which can buy some native products from southern barbarian foreign race to sell.</p>
<p>In this way, Changning Province businessmen can still make ends meet, but the people are miserable, there is no arable land, the opportunity to work is pitiful.</p>
<p>Just like Li Qing, it is better to carry big packing cars, carry goods and earn a meal a day at the gate, at least than those who don&rsquo;t have a job and are hungry.</p>
<p>In the past, Su Xin joined Flying Eagle Gang, for the same reason. He was young, although he had some strength, but he went to the workers to see that he did not want to be young.</p>
<p>And even if he wanted him, the salary was not enough to support him and the Xin&rsquo;er two people, so in the end Su Xin chose Flying Eagle Gang.</p>
