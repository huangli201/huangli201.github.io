  </small>
  <h2>chapter17 Assassination</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>The Paradise Square, Li Huai with Suxin Jinsheng gambling ran straight away.</p>
<p>Dai Chong likes to gamble, Huang Bingcheng has found out, these days Dai Chong every day in Jinsheng gambling shop.</p>
<p>And Zhang Hong, who knew he had caused trouble, was also waiting with Dai Chong ,to curry favor with his boss.</p>
<p>Su Xin may have been to Yongle Square before, but his memory is a little blurred after the trip, so he is now looking at everything around him, not curious, but to choose the best escape route after the assassination.</p>
<p>Dares to assassinate Dai Chong, Su Xin is not reckless because of the whim, but after he has 90% assurance, he will make such a choice.</p>
<p>As early as three days ago, he had already opened thirty-six orifices, and was officially promoted the begining of HouTian realm.</p>
<p>Thirty-six acupoints are connected, forming a  number of Lesser Heavenly Revolution, and the true qi circulates continuously.</p>
<p>Now Su Xin, can already be called the real martial arts.</p>
<p>The third master tiger once said that none of the thirteen leaders of the flying eagle gang got through all 36 orifices.</p>
<p>So Su Xin guessed that the same is true of the Qingzhu gang, which is similar in strength to the flying eagle gang.</p>
<p>Dai Chong may have cultivated his internal skill, but he never got through thirty-six orifices and became an early warrior the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if Su Xin miscalculated, Dai Chong was at the beginning of the HouTian realm, and he was not afraid of it.</p>
<p>In the case of the same level, Su Xin, who was carrying a dead sword, was also 90% sure of killing Dai Chong.</p>
<p>The killing power of this swordplay is quite amazing.</p>
<p>Coming to the gate of Jinsheng gambling house, Su Xin said to Li Huai, &ldquo;wait until I get close to Dai Chong, just keep at the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;give me a reason.&rdquo; Li Huai frowned.</p>
<p>Su Xin this arrangement is simply to let him break, can not personally participate in the assassination of Dai Chong, Li Huai is very regrettable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First look at your face. If you go to assassinate Dai Chong, you may be stopped by his men if you are not within ten meters of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Li Huai that dead face, just put &lsquo;not a good person&rsquo; four words engraved on the face, who will be uncomfortable to see.</p>
<p>If you let him go, it&rsquo;s not assassination, it&rsquo;s assault.</p>
<p>Li Huai was speechless for a while, but he had to nod.</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s heavy sword was too bad, so he put it in a wooden box and gave it to Li Huai for safekeeping. He hid the sword in the cuff.</p>
<p>This time, he was wearing a gorgeous brocade robe with huge cuffs. It was obvious that there was a sword hidden in it.</p>
<p>Su Xin was dressed as if he was a playboy from another family. At the moment of entering Jinsheng gambling house, his temperament suddenly changed.</p>
<p>From killing the decisive Su boss, into a suave man, which makes Li Huai a stupefied.</p>
<p>At least his dead face can&rsquo;t make that change.</p>
<p>The scale of Jinsheng casino is not small, which is three points larger than the original Shunde casino of boss Huang.</p>
<p>The hall was full of loud shouts, which made the whole hall look a little smoky.</p>
<p>Some boys and beautiful maids walked back and forth with some drinks and snacks, which was obviously learned from Happy Forest.</p>
<p>The model of joyful forest has been spread all over Changning Prefecture for a long time. Although it is impossible for them to copy the model of joyful forest completely due to the relationship of land, some good small steps can be learned.</p>
<p>Su Xin smiled and touched a pretty maid. In the coquetry of the maid, he took a pot of wine and walked towards Dai Chong.</p>
<p>Dai Chong&rsquo;s hobby is very strange.</p>
<p>When people with status and status go to the casino, they usually play two games in the elegant room, while Dai Chong likes to gamble with people in the lobby.</p>
<p>At this time Dai Chong is following three people to push the card nine there, his last home is Zhang Hong, at this time is carefully feeding the card to Dai Chong.</p>
<p>Last time I killed the guild members of the flying eagle sect. Although Dai Chong pressed the matter down, Dai Chong apologized to the flying eagle sect and lost his face.</p>
<p>His boss Dai is moody. Although he has nothing to do for the time being, if he loses at the gambling table one day and leads to a bad mood, he may think of it and clean him up.</p>
<p>So recently Zhang Hong is not in the mood to manage his own territory, all day in Dai Chong side, want to make this boss comfortable, so that forget this matter.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhang Hong looked up and saw Su Xin, who was staggering over with a wine pot. He frowned and said impatiently, &ldquo;Hey, where&rsquo;s your boy? Is this where you can come? Get out of my way. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin turned his mouth and looked scornful: &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter? Is this gambling house owned by your family? You are the only tables in the hall. Why can&rsquo;t I come?</p>
<p>Xiao Ye I pretend with large garlic cloves, have the capability to go upstairs dining rooms inside play, ah, sort of in charge inside the hall uncle? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grass! You don&rsquo;t want to mix up, do you? &quot; Zhang Hongton clapped the table.</p>
<p>Dai Chong skimmed Su Xin, stood waiting on the men Nunu mouth, motioned them to drive Su Xin out, by the way to teach him how to be a man.</p>
<p>Although Su Xin dressed like a rich boy, Dai Chong did not put it in his eyes at all.</p>
<p>There are many rich businessmen in Yongle Square. Who dares to challenge him to wear a big leader? The boy was taught a lesson today and can only blame him for not having eyes.</p>
<p>But at this time, Dai Chong, who had just turned his eyes to the table, suddenly felt a sharp edge across his eyes. A cold killing machine shrouded him in an instant, like a bloodthirsty wolf, showing ferocious fangs to himself!</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s sword has gone out of its sheath.</p>
<p>No one saw how the fine sword appeared in his hands.</p>
<p>That abrupt sword is like lightning, there is no cover-up, there is only one goal, that is, Dai Chong&rsquo;s neck!</p>
<p>Zhang Hong saw this sword, and several helpers around Dai Chong also saw it, but they could not react at all.</p>
<p>After a month of practice, the proficiency of 30% of the fast sword is simply not something these small characters can stop.</p>
<p>Li Huai, who is guarding at the door and has been paying attention to the internal movement, naturally sees this sword.</p>
<p>The sword also let Li Huai abnormal shock.</p>
<p>He also used swords, and was also famous for his fast swords under the third master tiger.</p>
<p>But compared with Su Xin&rsquo;s sword, he is not only not fast enough, but also not cruel enough, not spicy enough!</p>
<p>At this critical moment, Dai Chong&rsquo;s head was suddenly deviated, this amazing sword, across Dai Chong&rsquo;s neck, but only brought out a blood mark.</p>
<p>The heart beat violently, Dai Chong at this time did not avoid a blow of pride, there is only luck, from the ghost door to go back to the lucky!</p>
<p>Suxin this sword fast, ruthless, spicy have played to the extreme, if he had not found the edge of the blade reflection in the moment of looking back, coupled with his years of fighting experience made him subconsciously hide, I am afraid he has become a corpse now!</p>
<p>&ldquo;who are you!?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dai Chong immediately grasped the gold hammer of the drum beating urn beside him, and there was a lingering color of fear in his eyes.</p>
<p>Su Xin suddenly smiled and said, &ldquo;I am&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Voice did not fall, lightning like a sword hit again, the angle tricky strange.</p>
<p>This time, Dai Chong, who is on guard, will no longer let Suxin get it so easily.</p>
<p>With a swing of the gold hammer of the drum jar in his hand, the situation of Mount Tai pressing the top suddenly hit. If Su Xin didn&rsquo;t hide, he would be smashed into a puddle of meat mud even if he could stab the sword in his hand into Dai Chong&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>But to Dai Chong&rsquo;s expectation, Suxin did not seem to see this hammer hit in general, unexpectedly did not stop at all.</p>
<p>Dai Chong, a good big leader , naturally does not want to die with Suxin, a fellow who does not even know his identity.</p>
<p>So he had to change temporarily, beat the drum urn gold hammer across the chest, reluctantly blocked the sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zheng!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a shrill sound of gold and iron, and the two men changed their faces at the same time.</p>
<p>On the gold hammer of Dai Chong&rsquo;s drum beating urn, a deep sword trace can be seen clearly. The power of Su Xin&rsquo;s sword is beyond his imagination.</p>
<p>What makes Su Xin&rsquo;s color change is that he is right about Dai Chong&rsquo;s strength, but he also misses a bit.</p>
<p>Dai Chong did not break through the begining of HouTian realm but his own strength is very large, which is a natural power.</p>
<p>The begining of Houtian Realm  is the first hurdle of the martial arts, but the improvement of the strength of the martial arts is limited.</p>
<p>You can get through thirty-six orifices to make your muscles and bones strong and your qi and blood strong, but there is nothing else.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Houtian Realm, the poor internal power can&rsquo;t even release the real Qi.</p>
<p>So although he did not break through to the begining of HouTian realm, Dai Chong&rsquo;s natural power made up for this, and even made him stronger than the real martial arts in the  begining of HouTian realm.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, those who dare to use the gold hammer of drum beating urn are all peerless generals.</p>
<p>Although with the strength of Dai Chong, can only wave a drum urn gold hammer, but under this blow, Su Xin&rsquo;s hand is already numb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;take this boy alive! I&rsquo;d like to see who tried to kill me! &quot;</p>
<p>Dai Chong roared angrily, Jinsheng gambling shop those green bamboo help people only then reacted, hurriedly pulled out all kinds of swords, toward Su Xin to kill.</p>
<p>Other gamblers rushed out screaming at the sight of it, and the scene suddenly became chaotic.</p>
<p>Dai Chong is also a big leader, of course, there will not be only a few people around the casino, there are dozens of people, which makes Su Xin thankful that this time he brought Li Huai.</p>
<p>At this time, Li Huai did not disappoint Su Xin.</p>
<p>In the face of those gang members who rushed to Su Xin, Li Huai suddenly shot.</p>
<p>His weapon is two daggers, only nine inches long. It&rsquo;s not so much a dagger as two daggers.</p>
<p>Li Huai holds the sword with his back hand. The speed of the sword is extremely fast, and it is also extremely cruel. The sword is out of the throat, without exception.</p>
<p>No one thought that the assassin still has associates.</p>
<p>Li Huai, who suddenly came out of the crowd, killed four or five people in the blink of an eye.</p>
