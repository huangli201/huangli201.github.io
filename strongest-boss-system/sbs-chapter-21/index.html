  <h2>chapter21 acting school</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>&ldquo;because I&rsquo;m from Flying Eagle Gang, that&rsquo;s why I chose to assassinate Dai Chong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin looked passionate: &ldquo;Dai rushed to kill my brother, provoking me Flying Eagle Gang, is unpardonable!&rdquo; I Suxin can be where I am today, all by the cultivation of Flying Eagle Gang, humiliating me Flying Eagle Gang, is insulting me Suxin! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;then can you consider the consequences of this?&rdquo; Dong Chengwu snorted coldly.</p>
<p>Su Xin patted himself on the chest: &ldquo;my parents died early. I didn&rsquo;t read many books. I didn&rsquo;t expect that many. Anyway, I already killed all the people. If this affected the gang, I would like to apologize for my death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I said was impassioned, and it really moved a lot of people.</p>
<p>After all, the big leaders and the three Hall Master were fight from the bottom, and when they were young, they dared to fight but impulsively, just like Su Xin, and they didn&rsquo;t expect so much of the overall situation.</p>
<p>However, Third master tiger almost secretly vomited blood, eager to expose Suxin on the spot.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t read that much, don&rsquo;t you think?</p>
<p>At the beginning, Su Xin had a skilful tongue and directly turned himself from the sinner who killed the boss into the little leader of the happy forest. He was simply better than the fox!</p>
<p>And look at Su Xin in a month on the happy Lin those businessmen play around, this boy seems to have no heart, impulsive and irritable look?</p>
<p>The people present have not been in contact with Su Xin, do not know his temperament, Third master tiger although know, but he can only pretend to be invisible in the corner, do not dare to speak.</p>
<p>In any case, Su Xin is one of his men, or the adopted son of himself, and if he falls to the well in front of so many people, his Third master tiger reputation in Flying Eagle Gang will be completely tarnished.</p>
<p>And if he had to deal with Su Xin, he might have to eat melons along with him. How could he dare to open his mouth to attract the attention of others?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! Apologize for your death? If we really go to war with green bamboo gang, we Flying Eagle Gang will not die one or two people. Can you afford to lose your life alone? &quot; Dong Chengwu was not at all moved by Su Xin&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>Dong Chengwu was not moved by Su Xin&rsquo;s words, but some people were moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so cold-blooded, Lao Dong. When we started Flying Eagle Gang, I chopped off the three heads of Sheng Le Fang with a firewood knife, seizing the first territory for us Flying Eagle Gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talking to the three Hall Master of the battle Hall Master Lin Fu Hu, tall and mighty, in charge of the three major hallway Lin Fu Hu War Hall, Lin Fu Hu body is also the heaviest.</p>
<p>Su Xin shone his eyes and said, &ldquo;as soon as I entered Flying Eagle Gang, I heard about Hall Master Lin. One person, one knife, fought the first piece of territory for me, Flying Eagle Gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the hero does not mention the courage of that year, these past events do not matter.&rdquo; Lin Fu Hu tone modest, but there is an undisguised color, after all, this is the proudest record of his life.</p>
<p>Dong Chengwu glanced at Su Xin and frowned at Lin Fu Hu: &ldquo;Lao Lin, this is not the same as when we were a gang start-up, that is, we had to work hard to break into some family business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now the gang has become formal, and now to go to war with the same strength of the green bamboo gang, we do not get a trace of the benefits. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin Fu Hu disapprovingly waved his hand and said, &ldquo;Dong Chengwu, I think the older you are, the more timid you are. It&rsquo;s just going to war with green bamboo gang. We haven&rsquo;t fought with him, green bamboo gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think this boy is good, have my then demeanor, not only should not be punished, but also should be rewarded.</p>
<p>If not, would it not chill the young people who are bent on working for the gang? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re being unreasonable! Fighting for the gang and not following orders are two different things! &quot; Dong Chengwu slammed and slapped the table and almost knocked over the teacup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dong Chengwu, what do you mean? Who are you slapping the table with? Do you think I scared you ? &quot; Lin Fu Hu stood up with a ferocious light in his eyes.</p>
<p>Seeing such a fierce quarrel between the two people, Su Xin secretly smiled in his heart, Huang Bingcheng&rsquo;s information is really accurate.</p>
<p>Just took over happy Lin, Su Xin once asked Huang Bingcheng some high-level information about Flying Eagle Gang, of course, in Huang Bingcheng&rsquo;s eyes, these are just gossip.</p>
<p>It is well known that Flying Eagle Gang Three Great Hall Lords, is at odds with Hall Master Lin Fuhu and torture Hall Master Dong Chengwu.</p>
<p>Lin Fu Tiger is irritable by nature, and impulsive to protect the short.</p>
<p>Dong Chengwu is iron and selfless. Once he violates the rules of help, it doesn&rsquo;t work for anyone to talk about it.</p>
<p>A few years ago, during a battle, one of the disciples of, War Hall committed gang rules because he deliberately killed the surrendered gang of rival gangs. Dong Chengwu wanted to abolish him as a sign of punishment, and Lin Fuhu, who protected him, naturally came to plead with him.</p>
<p>In his opinion, what&rsquo;s the big deal of killing a surrendering gang? They&rsquo;re all bloody men. It&rsquo;s normal not to stop once in a while.</p>
<p>Later, the result of the matter can be imagined, Dong Chengwu did not give Lin Fu Hu face, on the spot will be the battle of Hallmaster&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s hands and feet, so that he became a waste person, the two Cousin beams will be completely knotted down.</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s current experience is similar to that of the original war with disciple of the War Hall, Lin Fuhu will naturally prefer him in his mind.</p>
<p>Just Su Xin&rsquo;s impassioned words may be some affectation in Dong Chengwu&rsquo;s eyes, but in Lin Fu Hu&rsquo;s view, this is a good disciple of Flying Eagle Gang, young and warm-blooded, dare to fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s enough! Together, the two men are nearly a hundred years old. After all these years of quarrelling, haven&rsquo;t they quarreled enough? &quot; The sand flying eagle opened his mouth, and the two men immediately stopped talking and went back to their seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhuang Li, what do you think?&rdquo; Asked Sha Fei Eagle to Good Deeds Hall Master Zhuang Li.</p>
<p>Look at the surface of the village Li short fat, full of friendly smile, not like a gang boss, but like a rich man in general.</p>
<p>Hearing the sand flying eagle speak, Zhuang Li smiled and replied, &ldquo;what idea can my Lao Zhuang have?&rdquo; Just listen to what we&rsquo;re talking about. However, it is better to deal with this matter safely, once it is not done well, as Hall Master Lin said, it is easy to let the disciples in the gang feel cold. &quot;</p>
<p>Dong Chengwu took a deep look at Zhuang Li and a trace of haze flashed through his eyes.</p>
<p>All the people present, as long as they were not too stupid, recognized the meaning of Zhuang Li&rsquo;s words, and he supported Lin Fuhu.</p>
<p>Dong Chengwu is selfless. During his time at the helm of Punishment Hall, there were more disciples in his hands than, Good Deeds Hall, who was not the only one who had War Hall.</p>
<p>Good Deeds Hall is in charge of the money and grain in the gang, and it is normal to fish for a little money in secret, but as long as Dong Chengwu finds out, it is necessary to peel off the skin of the undead.</p>
<p>It is just that Zhuang Li&rsquo;s city government is not as shallow as Lin Fu Hu, even if he resents Dong Chengwu in his heart, he will not tear his face with him on the spot.</p>
<p>Of course, there are no minority obedience to the rules of the majority in the Flying Eagle Gang. The three Hall Master just express their positions and make a decision, or Gang Master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;cough.&rdquo; Sha Fei Eagle coughed and said, &ldquo;about Suxin, we should deal with it carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you kill Dai Chong, you should be rewarded, or even elevate your status directly to the big leader.</p>
<p>But there are no rules, the Gang has been strictly ordered you not to provoke green bamboo gang, but you still do it, this is to ignore the rules, must be punished.</p>
<p>So this time, even if the merits and demerits are equal, you will not be punished, but you have to remember that only those who obey the rules can live longer. &quot;</p>
<p>The last sentence, Sha Feiying took a deep look at Su Xin, the words contain a different meaning.</p>
<p>Hearing the judgment of Sha Feiying, Dong Chengwu&rsquo;s face was somewhat unattractive. Without punishing Su Xin, it means that Sha Feiying stood on the side of Lin Fu Hu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gang Master, what are we going to do to give green bamboo gang an answer? If one of them dies, Dai Chong, I&rsquo;m afraid they won&rsquo;t give up. &quot; Dong Chengwu asked unwillingly.</p>
<p>Sha Feiying waved his hand and said, &ldquo;if you don&rsquo;t stop, you won&rsquo;t stop., green bamboo gang was supposed to be weaker than us. Now Dai Chong is dead. If they want to be real, we&rsquo;ll play with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I believe that green bamboo gang&rsquo;s people are not idiots, dead Dai Chong such a fierce general, they suffer even more in the fight.</p>
<p>But neither can we take it lightly and tell our brothers to cheer me up and get ready for war, and if anything happens, just start fighting! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The big leaders present agreed.</p>
<p>Lin Fu Hu on the face of the color, they War Hall is the most afraid to help, the more fierce the fight, the more credit they War Hall get.</p>
<p>Dong Chengwu shook off and took a deep look at Su Xin as he left.</p>
<p>Lin Fu Hu patted Su Xin hard on the shoulder and laughed and said, &ldquo;you are good, to my taste, one person and one sword dare to assassinate Dai Chong, bold enough!&rdquo; If you hadn&rsquo;t been the little leader now, I would have brought you to War Hall. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you Hall Master Lin for his love. When I joined Flying Eagle Gang,  thought of you as my idol.&rdquo; Su Xin skillfully kissed the ass and coaxed the war Hall Master away with a smile.</p>
<p>After all the other big leaders left, Third master tiger stood up and patted Su Xin on the shoulder. &ldquo;good job, but next time, remember, don&rsquo;t be so impulsive. You can talk to your godfather about something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin bowed his head and said, &ldquo;the child is just afraid of causing trouble to the godfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what are you talking about? Do I look like a man afraid of trouble, your godfather? &quot; Third master tiger pretended to be unhappy with a reprimand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the child knows, and if such a thing happens again in the future, the child will certainly discuss it with your godfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two words a pair of &lsquo;father filial piety&rsquo; appearance, also do not know to whom to see, hypocritical for a while, this just left Main Hall.</p>
<p>Outside the door, Master Li and Huang Bingcheng were a little anxious. When they saw Suxin coming out safely, they immediately knew that Suxin had survived safely.</p>
<p>However, the reactions of the two men were different. Huang Bingcheng was surprised and Master Li was stunned.</p>
