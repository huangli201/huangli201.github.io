  <h2>chapter24 Imparting merit method</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>In hallway&rsquo;s single room, Su Xin sat in a chair drinking tea, and soon Huang Bingcheng came in with Li Huai pushing the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss Su.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Su boss is Li Huai shout, but let Huang Bingcheng a good surprise.</p>
<p>When he first met this guy, he was very arrogant, and even made it clear that he would not listen to Suxin&rsquo;s orders. How can he shout boss Su now?</p>
<p>However, Huang Bingcheng did not think much, his boss&rsquo;s wrist is very clever, to be able to convince this Li Huai is not surprising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;sit down, don&rsquo;t stand up, I&rsquo;m here to discuss something with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin asked the two men to sit down and asked, &ldquo;what do you think of the people I work for now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Huai does not care about these things, Huang Bingcheng excitedly said: &ldquo;simply put, four words, the hearts of the people can be used ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin laughed and scolded: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use idioms indiscriminately. If this is heard by the government, be careful to throw you into prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng said with a smile, &ldquo;anyway, that&rsquo;s what you mean, boss. You&rsquo;re generous. Our brothers get more money than War Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And you can fight hard with the big leader of green bamboo gang for your brothers, and that&rsquo;s what moved the boys to tears. Even if you now order them to attack Yongle Square, they dare to carry knives. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin tapped on the table with his finger and said, &ldquo;Yes, morale is good, but it&rsquo;s not enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng is a little confused. In his opinion, Su Xin&rsquo;s men are already good enough.</p>
<p>Like those of other small leaders, most of them are old grease stripes, and they make do with extortion and fights on weekdays, and once they are serious, keep them at the back.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Su Xin&rsquo;s men are full of young people who dare to fight and dare to fight, and they have long been convinced by Su Xin, even if there are a few old people, but also slowly integrate into this atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now if Su Xin goes to war with others, guarantee that they will cry out and rush up. This momentum is within the Flying Eagle Gang, that is, the well-paid War Hall.</p>
<p>Su Xin shook his head: &ldquo;originally I thought it was good, but the last time I went to the door of Main Hall, the disciple of War hall, you can see that there are less than 200 people under me, and the other side can solve all of them with only ten people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng was immediately dumbfounded: &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not exaggerating, are you?&rdquo; Twenty people hit one of them, but they can&rsquo;t beat it? &quot;</p>
<p>He knew that War Hall&rsquo;s disciples were strong, but he never thought they would be so strong.</p>
<p>Su Xin shook his head. &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t practiced martial arts. You can&rsquo;t feel the powerful blood and awe-inspiring killing on them. If you say something bad, they are chicks who haven&rsquo;t seen blood.&rdquo; compared with others, that&rsquo;s a scum. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Huai, who has been silent, also opened his mouth: &ldquo;boss Su said that the disciples of, War Hall are very strong. I can fight with them, but I can&rsquo;t beat three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng suddenly opened his eyes to how strong, War Hall&rsquo;s disciples were. He had never seen how powerful, Li Huai was, but he knew it.</p>
<p>The former Third master tiger&rsquo;s first thug, who died in double digits, was the outsider who died at his disposal.</p>
<p>And last time Li Huai also followed Su Xin to assassinate Dai Chong, two people just rushed out of green bamboo gang&rsquo;s territory, this strength can be imagined.</p>
<p>But even with the strength of the Li Huai, it is no match for the three battles of War hall?</p>
<p>Li Huai said calmly, &ldquo;War Hall&rsquo;s disciples were carefully selected by Flying Eagle Gang. They were strong and strong. They were trained from an early age. Every meal was beef and eggs, and they ate five meals a day. In the evening, they soaked their bodies with herbs to strengthen their qi and blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They do not have to inspect the site every day, the only thing to do is to practice martial arts, but also fight Hall Master Lin Fuhu personally instructed, and sometimes Gang Master will even come off to teach.</p>
<p>But this is not a real disciple of War Hall, only in the fight to kill more than ten people undead, in order to become the real war Cousin son. &quot;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng said strangely, &ldquo;how do you know so clearly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;because I wanted to join War Hall, in the first place but ended up being brushed off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;with your&rsquo;s strength, you can be brushed off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Huai said in a calm voice: &ldquo;my parents died, my uncle took the family property, abused for a year, by the time I escaped to join the War Hall, my face was already yellow and skinny and weak, and of course I would be brushed off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was also the first time he had heard of Li Huai&rsquo;s family, Huang Bingcheng. He couldn&rsquo;t help asking, &ldquo;what happened to the uncle who took your fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng shrunk his neck and cursed himself for being cheap. He should have known this was the result.</p>
<p>Su Xin knocked on the table: &ldquo;all right, stop gossiping. I&rsquo;m here today to discuss a way to enhance the strength of my brothers. My men can&rsquo;t lose to War Hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard.&rdquo; Li Huai shook his head.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng disagreed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just eating meat at once. We have plenty of money now, and we&rsquo;re still short of a few meals of meat.&rdquo; At that time, we will expand the training ground in the hallway backyard, and the boss will personally teach them. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Huai sneered: &ldquo;kung fu can not be practiced in a day, if you go on like this, you can only practice the flower shelf, not the War Hall who can play dozens of masters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What else does Huang Bingcheng have to say? Su Xin waved his hand and said, &ldquo;Li Huai is right about, War Hall. It took Flying Eagle Gang several years to develop them. We want to rise to the level of War Hall in a short time, and it is impossible to use this method again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Li Huai, have you ever learned Internal strength?&rdquo; Su Xin asked suddenly as soon as he turned to the front of the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Li Huai is Third master tiger&rsquo;s first thug, but even Third master tiger&rsquo;s former righteous son Chen is not qualified to learn the internal skills of Third master tiger, of course, he is unlikely to learn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;if I give you an internal skill now, how many times do you think you can improve your strength?&rdquo; Asked Su Xin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;at least ten times!&rdquo; Li Huai&rsquo;s eyes lit up.</p>
<p>Now the strength of Li Huai has reached a limit, he joined Flying Eagle Gang for several years, as Third master tiger&rsquo;s first thug, is not worried about eating and drinking, their own bones and muscles have been very strong.</p>
<p>But this is a limit for Li Huai, he is not Dai Chong&rsquo;s natural power, now for him, no matter how much exercise can not be increased.</p>
<p>Unless he has practiced his internal skills, nourished qi and blood with internal forces, and opened the key points, he will be able to go one step further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;your strength can be improved tenfold, so even if the ordinary gang is not as strong as you, after learning internal skills can also increase the combat strength several times, so my way is, let my men, learn internal skills!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin took out the &ldquo;Quanzhen Junior Internal skills&rdquo; copied last night and threw it on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Internal work and mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Huai stood up from his chair as soon as he rubbed it, and Huang Bingcheng jumped next to him.</p>
<p>He had never seen this man so excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;is this for us to practice?&rdquo; Asked Li Huai.</p>
<p>Su Xin nodded as if he could hear a shiver in Li Huai&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>But Li Huai does have a reason to be excited. It can be said that this kind of thing is the existence he has always dreamed of.</p>
<p>If there were no Internal strength, the current Li Huai would have been the limit of his life, he is just a little a gang member, can play a lot of people.</p>
<p>Although he knew that Gang Master and the three Hall Master knew internal skills, even big leaders such as Third master tiger, he never expected them to teach himself.</p>
<p>For the Jiang Hu, internal skill is a secret, not to mention their little gang.</p>
<p>Even if Chen, the righteous son of Third master tiger, has not been taught by Third master tiger, what qualifications does he Li Huai have to be taught?</p>
<p>Later, when he went with Su Xin to assassinate Dai Chong, he knew that Su Xin would be able to do the same, but he did not have any superfluous ideas in his heart.</p>
<p>Their relationship with Suxin is not close, and has also been vicious words to face each other, Suxin does not hold a grudge is already a lot of adults, but also extravagantly expect what internal skills?</p>
<p>He did not expect that Su Xin today unexpectedly threw out the precious internal work and mind method directly, and asked him to practice it with great generosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is there anything wrong with it?&rdquo; Seeing Li Huai like this, Su Xin asked with a smile.</p>
<p>Li Huai looked up and said in a deep voice, &ldquo;the Internal strength and mind method is a secret that does not spread. Even if it is a Jiang Hu school, it must be learned only after worshiping a teacher. None of us in Flying Eagle Gang, has ever taught internal skills to ordinary gangs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;do you know why?&rdquo; Asked Su Xin.</p>
<p>Li Huai said, &ldquo;because Internal strength  is precious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin sneered: &ldquo;precious fart!&rdquo; Even if this thing is no matter how precious, it is not consumable. After learning this, you can&rsquo;t learn that. Gang Master and the big leaders do not pass on their internal skills to their men because they are afraid! &quot;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng and Li Huai are all in a daze, scared? What are they afraid of?</p>
<p>&ldquo;what isInternal strength? It is a watershed between ordinary people and martial arts. Only by learning Internal strength can you have endless possibilities in the future. Otherwise, you can spend your whole life in this corner of Changning House.</p>
<p>Third master tiger has practiced his internal skills for more than ten years, but he has not been able to get through 36 key points. What if someone under him becomes better than him after learning internal skills? Is it time for him to abdicate?</p>
<p>Gang Master and the three Hall Master are stronger, but that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re afraid of. With strength, the heart is wild, and naturally it is not so easy to control. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;then you&rsquo;re not afraid?&rdquo; Li Huai looked up and asked.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng glanced at him, but the master dared to ask him anything.</p>
<p>Su Xin smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;because I will go further than you.&rdquo;</p>
