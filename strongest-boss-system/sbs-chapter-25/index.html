    Strongest Boss System
  </small>
  <h2>There is no absolute waste of martial arts.</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Instruct subordinate helps internal merit,. This is what Su Xin decided yesterday.</p>
<p>His strength is still too weak, although he can kill Dai Chong, but that is only because of the sneak attack assassination reasons, hit Dai Chong a surprise.</p>
<p>If there is another occasion, it is still unknown who wins or loses.</p>
<p>And this time to Main Hall, to see the three Hall Master and unfathomable Gang Master,Su Xin very clear, their current strength compared with them, or too far away.</p>
<p>But Martial Dao cultivate pays attention to a step-by-step progress,System can only give their own auxiliary role, but can not let themselves become expert all of a sudden.</p>
<p>And the new Main Quest time limit is only one year, in improving their own strength at the same time, synchronously enhance the strength of subordinate, for the completion of Quest is also very important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;by the way, Old Boss, what if we pass on this internal merit and someone else steals it? In addition to a few who know the bottom of the brother, there are people who are not tight-lipped. &quot; Huang Bingcheng is a little worried.</p>
<p>He is the elderly, of Flying Eagle Gang over the years, he has seen a lot of ugly things about betraying Old Boss and brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;in the same way, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t have to think of this internal merit as a great Divine Merit secret book,.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin doesn&rsquo;t care: &ldquo;other people want to teach a long time ago. Maybe Gang Master&rsquo;s internal merit, is better than my internal merit. If someone wants to steal a lesson, let them learn. It&rsquo;s no big deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quanzhen Religion Primary Level Internal Merit&rdquo; is only an entry-level merit law, of 0.5 Star, and even in this world, it is estimated to be the lowest level of existence.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng said this Su Xin thought a long time ago, although he has a high reputation in Happy Forest, but he is not narcissistic to his Air of a Tyrant, a little bit of the lil&rsquo; bro will be loyal to death.</p>
<p>He was sure that once he passed on internal merit to, Third master tiger et al., he would bully and seduce his subordinate people and ask them to speak up about internal merit.</p>
<p>But Su Xin does not care, he passed down internal merit, just to increase the strength of his subordinate, Third master tiger and others get internal merit pass or not, has nothing to do with his Su Xin.</p>
<p>If Third master tiger does not pass on, Su Xin, it can start to develop at ease.</p>
<p>And if he is afraid that the strength of Su Xin can not be controlled, he will also pass the internal merit to his own subordinate, estimate effect is not great, because the Third master tigersubordinate those who help the crowd does not have the money.</p>
<p>Low Grade&rsquo;s internal merit is only a means to assist cultivate, Houtian Refines The Body, even if cultivatedinternal merit, is mainly tempered by their own body.</p>
<p>Most Martial Artist eats more than normal people in order to transform the essence of the food into their own qi and blood,.</p>
<p>Just like Shaolin Temple&rsquo;s, martial monk, outsiders think they are vegetarians, but in fact, they are big fish and meat for every meal.</p>
<p>Every day, barely keep alive on chaff and wild herbs, you can&rsquo;t get through a aperture hole for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Third master tiger subordinate has thousands of people, out of dozens of confidants, the rest of the public that a little money can only barely enough to feed and clothe.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, they have been rich and poor, with their money, for example, it is basically impossible to want cultivate internal merit.</p>
<p>And Third master tiger certainly does not have the courage to give him subordinate monthly money, if he dares to raise subordinate&rsquo;s monthly money to the same as that given by Su Xin, it may not take long for his Third master tiger to barely keep alive on chaff and wild herbs.</p>
<p>The situation of the whole Flying Eagle Gang is similar, the average gang can only barely mix food and clothing, this situation even if get internal merit, also can not practice any tricks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;there&rsquo;s one more question. Internal merit alone is not enough. They cultivate what martial skill?.&rdquo; Li Huai asked suddenly.</p>
<p>Su Xin was stunned, too, and he really forgot that.</p>
<p>Even if Houtian realm gets through a few aperture hole, it just adds a little bit of strength.</p>
<p>Empty-handed brute force and no corresponding martial skill, even if the fight is just to deliver food to people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Li Huai, can you give your swordsmanship to the brothers?&rdquo; Su Xin&rsquo;s memory of Li Huai&rsquo;s &lsquo;s double swords is still fresh, sneaky and sinister, &lsquo;s rapid and abnormal, the power is definitely not vulgar.</p>
<p>Li Huai hesitated, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay to teach, but I don&rsquo;t know any swordsmanship at all. I just figure it out when I&rsquo;m fighting people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin tapped slowly on the table with his index finger., Li Huai&rsquo;s swordplay is really like this. It can&rsquo;t even be called swordsmanship. It can only be said to be a kind of combat experience.</p>
<p>Li Huai&rsquo;s attack means is actually only three words: fast, accurate, ruthless.</p>
<p>It is possible for him to teach some basic skills, but to fully simulate his way of fighting, it is estimated that it will not be possible to practice without bloody fighting for dozens of games and killing dozens of people.</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s own two sect martial skills,Jing Wuming Quick Sword is simply not suitable for ordinary cultivate, even if Su Xin does not have that 5% proficiency, it is not easy to get started.</p>
<p>And Great Sumeru Sword Style changes complicated, swordsmanship exquisite, less talented Martial Artist can not cultivate, not to mention some of these do not even know the words of the ordinary help.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Su Xin suddenly remembered something. Mental immediately entered the System space and found the &lsquo;Broken Version Beating Dog Stick Method&rsquo; he threw into the corner yesterday.</p>
<p>Opening the &lsquo;Broken Version&rsquo; Beating Dog Stick Method&rsquo;,Su Xin took a closer look, and suddenly there was an impulse to laugh.</p>
<p>Just now I am still worried that there is no suitable martial skill, for ordinary cultivate, in fact, he already got one yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after he drew this&rsquo; Broken Version Beating Dog Stick Method&rsquo;, he did not watch it carefully. Today, he saw that as long as it was used in the right place, there would be no absolute waste martial skill.</p>
<p>This&rsquo; Broken Version Beating Dog Stick Method&rsquo; does not have powerful tricks such as&rsquo; there is no dog in the world&rsquo;in the authentic Beating Dog Stick Method. It has only the basic usage of tripping, chopping, entangling, poking, picking, quoting, sealing and turning.</p>
<p>One bamboo stick has eight changes, enough to cope with most cases, and the &lsquo;Broken Version Beating Dog Stick Method&rsquo; also comes with a joint attack.</p>
<p>36 people can make up the Small Heavenly Revolution Beating Dog Formation, and the Small Heavenly Revolution formation method can be split into 18-man Formation and 9-man Formation, with at least three people to be able to form formation, of course, the more people, the more powerful the formation method will be.</p>
<p>The beggars of the gang go out and beg in groups of three or twenty percent. If they encounter any unexpected situation, they can use this formation method to resist foreign enemies as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In fact, these are secondary, the most important thing is that cultivate this&rsquo; Broken Version Beating Dog Stick Method&rsquo; requirements are very low, even as long as you are not crippled, long eyes can cultivate, do not need to read.</p>
<p>Broken Version&rsquo;s Beating Dog Stick Method&rsquo; has no extra word except the cover, which is full of lifelike illustrations that children can understand.</p>
<p>This merit law is originally prepared for beggars to help some ordinary disciple, the most basic requirements are only four words: easy to understand.</p>
<p>Of course, the sects and factions with the largest number of Martial World in the world is the gang, and the disciple with the lowest quality is also the gang.</p>
<p>All mixed into beggars, how good can this quality be?</p>
<p>So what this&rsquo; Broken Version Beating Dog Stick Method&rsquo;, does is as simple as possible, and that&rsquo;s exactly what Su Xin&rsquo;s wants.</p>
<p>His subordinate,cultivate, which has no silk martial merit foundation, is just right.</p>
<p>Mental, Su Xin has come out of System, and for a moment gongfu | effort,Huang Bingcheng and Li Huai didn&rsquo;t even notice that Su Xin&rsquo;s was distracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;look at this martial skill.&rdquo; Su Xin took the &lsquo;Broken Version Beating Dog Stick Method&rsquo; out of his arms and threw it in front of the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beating Dog Stick Method? What kind of stupid name is this? &quot; Huang Bingcheng skimmed his mouth and disliked it for a while, and the name didn&rsquo;t sound like high-level.</p>
<p>Li Huai turned it over for a while and finally came to the conclusion: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not strong, but it&rsquo;s practical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;practical is enough. If this Beating Dog Stick Method were replaced by you, how long would it take to learn it? How long do you think the others will be able to get started? &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin comes with 5% proficiency and can get started at a glance. He just wants to know what it would be like to switch to someone else.</p>
<p>Li Huai thought for a moment and said, &ldquo;this stick method is only the simplest octave. If I come, I can learn it initially in a day. For others who have no martial merit foundation, it is estimated that it will take 2 to 5 days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin nodded, not for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Huang, you get someone to build 200 four-foot sticks with a double-faced spearpoint, on one end and tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng nodded. &ldquo;Old Boss, are you going to use this as a weapon?&rdquo; But this picture is clearly wooden stick. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;wooden stick is used to hit dogs. If you want to hit people, you still need a real guy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This kind of Low Grade Beating Dog Stick Method is just for ordinary people, a group of beggars, where do you have any money to buy weapon?? Pick up a wooden stick, of course, and think of it as a weapon.</p>
<p>Anyway, this martial skill is only for their own protection, and they are not expected to have much fighting power.</p>
<p>But if it is really a fight, people will be able to split your broken wooden stick in two, and then a fart?</p>
<p>Replace the wooden stick with an iron bar so that you can give full play to the genuine power of the Beating Dog Stick Method.</p>
<p>And Su Xin is also sinister in the iron bar to add spearpoint, and other fighting, the use of poking tips and picking tips, that stabbing the body is a blood hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;all right, that&rsquo;s it. Tomorrow morning, Old Huang, you send everyone to hallway. I&rsquo;ll teach you Beating Dog Stick Method,Li Huai. You teach everyone how to fight.&rdquo; Su Xin knocked on the table and made a decision.</p>
<p>Li Huai nodded and went out, but, Huang Bingcheng dawdled and asked with a smile, &ldquo;can I not learn that Old Boss,?&rdquo; You see, at my age, I can&rsquo;t practice any more tricks. &quot;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng is very clear about his position now, that is, the role of an executor.</p>
<p>Su Xin gives orders, and he is responsible for the perfect execution of the orders, which is fine.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s really not good at fighting or something.</p>
<p>In the past, when he was in Flying Eagle Gang, he could have experienced dozens of help battles, large and small, and he went back to hide in the back for fear of being hurt by blood.</p>
<p>Su Xin also knew what Huang Bingcheng was, and did not embarrass him. He just patted him on the shoulder and said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to learn to fight Old Huang,martial skill, but you have to learn internal merit. You don&rsquo;t want to be strong. At least it can play a role in strengthening your health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng knew this was almost the bottom line for Su Xin&rsquo;s, so he had to say yes.</p>
<p>Anyway, as long as he doesn&rsquo;t dance his sword fighting and killing, he Huang Bingcheng, boasts that he lives on his head.</p>
