    Strongest Boss System
  </small>
  <h2>chapter10 reject a face-saving offer </h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>All the bosses were thinking in secret, when suddenly came two sneers.</p>
<p>People look up, the voice is still boss Huang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss Su, your idea is really good, but it&rsquo;s a little unrealistic.</p>
<p>Businessmen chase profits, but also to their extreme, if we here according to what you say to do, in advance will indeed attract a lot of customers.</p>
<p>But if the people in changdefang react and follow our example, the advantages of the region are revealed immediately, and we still can&rsquo;t rob others. &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. Boss Huang&rsquo;s worry was reasonable. Those people in changdefang must be able to copy this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Su Xin put down his teacup and shook his head: &ldquo;they can&rsquo;t imitate it. There is a fatal defect in changdefang, that is, their land size is different.</p>
<p>Our Changle square is as like as two peas in the past. Even the floors are exactly the same. What about the Changde square?</p>
<p>There is a large and small shop, a small tavern on the first floor, and a big gambling house on the third floor.</p>
<p>There are various other shops, even some buildings in the Yamen of the state government.</p>
<p>In this way, they will not be able to achieve exchanges like ours.</p>
<p>Even if you want to imitate, at most, some powerful and rich businesses will directly dish down the surrounding stores and make our model.</p>
<p>The land value of changdefang, a central city, is great. How many businesses can have such a big hand?</p>
<p>As you all know, there are no more than five fingers of merchants with strong financial resources in Changning mansion. It&rsquo;s good to have 30% of the whole changdefang successfully imitated.</p>
<p>But these 30% can&rsquo;t meet the needs of the whole Changning mansion.</p>
<p>If the rest of the guests want to enjoy this service, they must come to our happy forest! &quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, everyone nodded, and Su Xin&rsquo;s plans went through a series of steps. Basically, he thought of all the possibilities he could think of.</p>
<p>Now many businesses are hesitant only that one percent of the dry shares.</p>
<p>For these merchants, the tens of taels of money paid each month are the same as gouging out their meat with a knife, let alone taking out 10% of the dry shares now.</p>
<p>After a long silence, boss Huang said, &ldquo;boss Su, you&rsquo;re a good idea. But I&rsquo;m in a small business in Shunde gambling house. I&rsquo;m short of money recently. I can&rsquo;t get any money. Let&rsquo;s not worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although boss Huang despises Suxin, he is still in favor of Suxin&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>However, he could not agree with the agreement.</p>
<p>There are too many 10% stocks. He doesn&rsquo;t want to give them, nor can he!</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;ve given it to Su Xin. What if the government or the adoptive father of Su Xin, the third uncle of tiger, is also going to dig up 10% of the shares?</p>
<p>So this opening must not be opened!</p>
<p>But not agreeing with the terms of susin doesn&rsquo;t mean he won&rsquo;t follow susin&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll put it off for a while, because I&rsquo;m short of money recently. After a while, he can still connect several bosses and follow Suxin&rsquo;s method.</p>
<p>At that time, Suxin wanted his shares, but it was not so easy.</p>
<p>All of them were old-fashioned. As soon as boss Huang spoke, they immediately understood what he meant.</p>
<p>However, these people are small in business and dare not openly fight with Suxin.</p>
<p>But if they don&rsquo;t speak, they will say no by default.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss Huang, sometimes people are too smart. In fact, it&rsquo;s not a good thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin sighed and slowly walked to boss Huang&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Looking at Su Xin approaching, boss Huang suddenly felt a chill on his body, which made him shiver fiercely.</p>
<p>However, he thought that his status was different from those of the tavern owners, so he forced out a smile: &ldquo;what do you mean, boss Su? I can&rsquo;t understand. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand? Then I&rsquo;ll explain it to you slowly. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s iron sword, which was hanging obliquely on his waist, was already in his hands.</p>
<p>He pulled boss Huang&rsquo;s right hand hard and pressed it on the table. The funny iron blade stabbed out. He put boss Huang&rsquo;s right hand on the table directly. After several feet, boss Huang&rsquo;s hand was suddenly left with only one hilt!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boss Huang let out a shrill howl. The splashed blood splashed on a person beside him. He was scared to retreat and kicked over the chair.</p>
<p>Everyone in the room was shocked. No one expected Su Xin to make a move. He didn&rsquo;t have any omens in advance!</p>
<p>Ji Gang&rsquo;s eyelids jumped and he didn&rsquo;t speak, but the smile on the corner of his mouth had converged and his eyes were shocked.</p>
<p>Li bad was staring at the iron sword that had fallen under the table all the time, and his eyes twinkled with unidentified meaning.</p>
<p>With a thin iron sheet, you can insert the human hand bones and an inch thick mahogany table just like inserting tofu. This kind of speed and strength is not common.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss Su, let&rsquo;s have something to say. Don&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo; Zuiyuanlou&rsquo;s boss Liu hurriedly persuades, but in fact, he is also frightened.</p>
<p>Even though they knew that refusing Suxin&rsquo;s request for dividend would offend him, they didn&rsquo;t expect him to say &ldquo;do it!&quot;!</p>
<p>Their identity is different from that of Wang Pang, who was beaten and maimed by Su Xin. That&rsquo;s just the boss of a small drugstore, but they are famous businessmen in Changning mansion.</p>
<p>Every year they pay thousands of liang of taxes to the government. Can the government watch them being bullied by gangs?</p>
<p>If the gangs cover the sky, who will pay taxes to the government and give all the money to the gangs as protection fees?</p>
<p>So the attitude of all the major gangs towards these big businessmen is good. As long as you keep the rules, I won&rsquo;t embarrass you.</p>
<p>A word like Su Xin doesn&rsquo;t agree with immediate action. That&rsquo;s a madman!</p>
<p>When the government was angry, the flying eagle sect couldn&rsquo;t stop it. The first one would throw him out as a scapegoat to the government!</p>
<p>All the present bosses will not be afraid even if they face the leader of flying eagle Gang, Sha flying eagle, because that&rsquo;s a person who speaks rules.</p>
<p>But now they have no choice but to meet Suxin, a lunatic who doesn&rsquo;t speak the rules.</p>
<p>Looking at the boss Huang, who was lying on the table in pain and sweating, Su Xin said quietly, &ldquo;really make a fool of me with Su Xin as a mallet? Procrastinate, use my plan, but not plan to give me dividends? Uh huh?</p>
<p>Boss Huang has been speechless in pain. When did a big boss like him, who has always maintained his dignity, suffer this crime?</p>
<p>At this time, Su Xin pulled the iron blade sword out of his right hand like lightning, then pressed his left hand on the table, and stabbed it in the same way!</p>
<p>Boss Huang suddenly let out another howl, listening to the presence of many bosses a heart jump, boss Huang these two hands, it is useless.</p>
<p>Su Xin looks around. None of the bosses here dare to look at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, I&rsquo;m a very polite person. I have a plan. When you make money and eat meat, I&rsquo;ll drink some soup. Is that too much?</p>
<p>Take my things but don&rsquo;t want to pay. Well, I can only pick them up myself. &quot;</p>
<p>The iron sword is pulled out. Su Xin grabs boss Huang&rsquo;s hair. The iron sword directly penetrates into his mouth and stirs fiercely. Suddenly a piece of blood red things are brought out.</p>
<p>Su Xin pasted it in boss Huang&rsquo;s ear and whispered, &ldquo;has anyone told you that your mouth is really smelly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, boss Huang can&rsquo;t hear any sound at this time. At the moment when Su Xin cut off his tongue, he has fainted with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, has anyone agreed to my plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the present bosses nodded their heads busily. Now, do they dare not agree with this situation? What I disagree with has become a waste man lying on the ground!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then sign the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a wave of Su Xin&rsquo;s hand, Huang Bingcheng immediately asked people to bring up all the ink, paper and inkstone and write down the transfer document of dry shares.</p>
<p>However, although no one said anything in the presence of all the bosses, they honestly wrote down the transfer document, but they kept sneering.</p>
<p>You Suxin did so much today. We&rsquo;ll see how you end up!</p>
<p>Wipe the bloody sword on boss Huang&rsquo;s body. Su Xin waves to Huang Bingcheng: &ldquo;go and call all the brothers in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are less than 70 guild members under Suxin, but when they all come in, it seems that the hall is a little crowded.</p>
<p>Those gang members shivered when they saw Huang, who was lying on the ground with his mouth full of blood, as if he were dead.</p>
<p>This eldest brother is really ruthless!</p>
<p>After a look at the guild members below, Su Xin said in a deep voice: &ldquo;those who come out of the Jianghu want to sell their lives for a good price.</p>
<p>I, Su Xin, am not a good man. I don&rsquo;t ask you to give me your life for nothing. Now I have an opportunity here. I just don&rsquo;t know if you dare to do it. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin points to the boss Huang lying on the ground: &ldquo;the boss Huang of Shunde gambling house is now abandoned by me, and you have seen it.</p>
<p>Now, if anyone comes out to the government to turn himself in and say that he is the one who has abandoned him, I will give him three hundred liang of silver. From then on, his family and parents, I su Xin, have raised him! &quot;</p>
<p>All the members of the group breathed quickly. For them, three hundred Liang silver was an astronomical figure.</p>
<p>At present, only a few of the guild members under Su Xin are the old people of the flying eagle sect, most of them are recruited from changlefang.</p>
<p>These people are born in slums. They are brave and ruthless in daily life, but they are hard to get enough to eat.</p>
<p>Now three hundred taels of silver were placed before them, and they could not help but be moved.</p>
<p>Seeing these people&rsquo;s moves, Su Xin added a fire: &ldquo;turning yourself in doesn&rsquo;t mean you&rsquo;ll die. I&rsquo;ll go outside and make sure you&rsquo;ll let it out within three years.</p>
<p>After three years in prison, I will surely have a place for you under Suxin! &quot;</p>
<p>All the bosses look at Su Xin in horror, and they still play like this?</p>
<p>At this time, a gang member, who was about 25 or 6 years old, stood up and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so guilty! Three hundred Liang silver is enough for my mother, my daughter-in-law and my son. &quot;</p>
<p>The gang member gave Su Xin a big hand: &ldquo;boss Su, I&rsquo;ll sell you my life. I just hope my brother in the gang can show me a little. Don&rsquo;t let my daughter-in-law steal people with my life selling money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole audience burst into laughter, but some of them secretly regretted it. Why didn&rsquo;t they come out?</p>
<p>Now think about it. Three years in prison for three hundred Liang silver. It&rsquo;s worth it!</p>
<p>They used to be locked up for months for petty thieving, fighting and other things. Now it&rsquo;s just a little longer. How can they help?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I don&rsquo;t want your life either. When you turn yourself in, I will immediately arrange a lawyer to protect you, and the silver will also be sent to your house.</p>
<p>All the brothers present can watch. Su Xin has his word. If he repents, I don&rsquo;t have to mix in this Changning mansion. &quot;</p>
<p>The gang nodded and turned straight away.</p>
<p>Many of the present bosses immediately hung their heads down and dared not have other ideas.</p>
<p>This moment&rsquo;s su Xin makes them feel more terrible than just killing boss Huang&rsquo;s su Xin.</p>
<p>He knows more about the government&rsquo;s mind than those gang members who only know how to fight and kill!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s right to hurt people and break the law, but the government will not consider who injured them. They will only consider their own achievements and face.</p>
<p>Su Xin now obediently brings the criminal to the front of others, who have the face.</p>
<p>Suxin given a lot of money. Why can&rsquo;t I trust Suxin?</p>
<p>As for boss Huang, no one will care. Even some businessmen are thinking about how to take over his Shunde gambling house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I will not leave you today when I have a talk with you. I think you have a plan in mind. In this period of time, you can start to decorate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the bosses look and lie on the ground. Boss Huang, who doesn&rsquo;t know his life or death, turns his mouth in secret.</p>
<p>Can it also be called Xiangtan Zhenghuan?</p>
<p>But now they dare not show their teeth to Su Xin, and they all smile and say goodbye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the others go down, too. Lao Huang will stay. By the way, take boss Huang down to me and take good care of him. Don&rsquo;t let him die. &quot; Su Xin ordered.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s different to hurt people and dead people. If boss Huang is really dead, it&rsquo;s hard for the government to explain.</p>
<p>When everyone left, Huang Bingcheng bowed and said with admiration: &ldquo;boss, you can think of such a way. I&rsquo;m really convinced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing. It&rsquo;s just a trick.&rdquo; Su Xin waved his hand.</p>
<p>Although Huang Bingcheng thinks Su Xin is modest, in fact, Su Xin is really just a trick.</p>
<p>There are many such things in the past.</p>
<p>No one has ever used it here, or even thought about it. That&rsquo;s because the gangs here are only interested in strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strength is the king&rsquo;s way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin sighed in his heart. If he has the strength, he doesn&rsquo;t need to engage in these low-key skills. These things are exactly what boss Huang&rsquo;s businessmen like to play.</p>
<p>Sha Feiying, the leader of the flying eagle Gang, has great strength the day after tomorrow. If this thing is changed to him, don&rsquo;t say that boss Huang is abandoned. Even if he is killed on the spot, the government will pretend not to see it.</p>
<p>The government also has its own power.</p>
<p>In addition to Changde square in the middle, there are forty-nine districts in Changning Prefecture, which are divided into twelve districts in the East, West, South and North, each of which has a chief constable.</p>
<p>Each of the four chief constables is the strength of the day after tomorrow. Their captains are more than 100, so they can suppress the three gangs and four guilds of Changning government, even the face suppression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lao Huang, I&rsquo;ll take three hundred Liang and send it to the offending brother in front of everyone.</p>
<p>Also go to find the most famous litigator in Changning mansion and ask him to help to get rid of the crime. The sentence must be less than three years.</p>
<p>You should know better than me which yamen should be dealt with in Changning mansion. You don&rsquo;t need to save money. You can do it to your heart&rsquo;s content. There are places to deal with in the future. &quot;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng said: &ldquo;it costs three hundred Liang to set up a family, but it&rsquo;s not expensive to be a litigant. You can find a good litigant in ten or more Liang, and I&rsquo;m afraid there are not a thousand Liang that can&rsquo;t come down in Yamen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin nodded, &ldquo;more than a thousand Liang, less than I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter how few we have, we can&rsquo;t bring them out.&rdquo; Huang Bingcheng said with a bitter face, &ldquo;our only five hundred Liang is for you to give to the tiger third master. Now there is only a little silver left in the sect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin said lightly: &ldquo;Shunde gambling house is so big. The wealth of the fat man is not 100000, but tens of thousands. Isn&rsquo;t that money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old&hellip; Boss! If boss Huang is abandoned, we can find someone to take the blame, but if we take the property of Shunde gambling house, the government will definitely step in. &quot; Huang Bingcheng was shocked and hurriedly dissuaded.</p>
<p>Hurting people and seizing wealth is more serious than abandoning boss Huang, which touches the bottom line of the government.</p>
<p>They are now Jianghu gangs. If they hurt people and rob money, they will become robbers who rob houses and houses. They have two natures as gangs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we can&rsquo;t eat tens of thousands of liang of silver. We didn&rsquo;t want to eat it. You can count all the properties of Shunde gambling house, make a list and give it to Mr. Hu Sanye. He will understand what I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The so-called government bottom line does not exist at all.</p>
<p>As long as there is enough money and strength, the so-called bottom line may go somewhere.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng walked out doubtfully, and Su Xin said, &ldquo;when you go, you may see Ji Gang. Don&rsquo;t be surprised, you may not see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nodded, Huang Bingcheng went out thinking.</p>
