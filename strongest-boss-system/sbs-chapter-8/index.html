  <h2>chapter8 It&#39;s cruel to kill. Beat the It&#39;s cruel to kill. Beat the disabled</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>There is only one medicine shop in the whole Changle square, which is next to the joyful forest.</p>
<p>Other people think changlefang is a slum. It has little oil and water. They are unwilling to open a drugstore here.</p>
<p>Happy forest is rich, but how many people can be sick in a street? To open a drugstore here is only to lose money.</p>
<p>But the manager of Wangji pharmacy think to be longer than others.</p>
<p>The poor can&rsquo;t see the disease, and the minor illness depends on the support. Only when they can&rsquo;t stand will they come to the drugstore and find a doctor.</p>
<p>At that time, he will be able to &ldquo;the lion starts to talk greatly&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There are three pound nails in a rotten boat. No matter how poor the people in changlefang are, they can squeeze out a little oil and water.</p>
<p>So the business of Wangji pharmacy is not only not bad, but also more profitable than that of some prosperous shops.</p>
<p>The Wang shopkeeper of Wangji pharmacy is over sixty years old. He is full of fat. He doesn&rsquo;t look like a doctor. He looks like a butcher who kills pigs.</p>
<p>At this time, shopkeeper Wang is enjoying it with a green bracelet.</p>
<p>The color of the jade bracelet is as clear as water, and there are some carved patterns on it. It looks extraordinary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, there is only one bracelet. If you make a pair, the price will be doubled several times.</p>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t know which family that little girl was from last time. Otherwise, I will try my best to get another bracelet. &quot;</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Wang sadly shook his head, put the bracelet back in the box, and prepared to go to the pawnshop and change it into silver when he had time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quick! Don&rsquo;t be lazy! Otherwise, all the monthly money of this month will be deducted! &quot;</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Wang yelled at the waiter in the drugstore. Just when he wanted to get up, he saw a handsome young man leading a little girl into the drugstore.</p>
<p>Seeing this little girl, shopkeeper Wang&rsquo;s eyes suddenly brightened. Isn&rsquo;t this the little girl who stole medicine from his drugstore the other day?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha ha! You little girl dare to come! Last time I wasted so many herbs, this bracelet is not enough! Give me the other one! &quot;</p>
<p>Xin&rsquo;er is frightened by shopkeeper Wang. She holds Su Xin&rsquo;s clothes tightly and says wrongly, &ldquo;but I have returned the medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! Can you still use the medicine that your dirty hand touched? &quot; Shopkeeper Wang gave a cold snort, with a disdainful look on his face.</p>
<p>Su Xin patted Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s small head and looked at shopkeeper Wang indifferently: &ldquo;what medicine needs to be compensated with two jade bracelets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Wang noticed Su Xin and said with a sneer, &ldquo;are you the family of this little girl? Look, what she took last time was pure Gaoli ginseng from Liaodong. They were all transported from the Eastern Jin Dynasty.</p>
<p>From the Eastern Jin Dynasty to our Zhou Dynasty, it&rsquo;s a distance of tens of thousands of miles. Each ginseng is worth hundreds of Liang! She ruined seven or eight of me at a time. Can you afford it? &quot;</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Wang specially took out a box of ginseng wrapped in red cloth and put it in front of them. He ate them to a certain look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheating! You lied to me. This is not what I took last time! &quot; Su Xin&rsquo;er was holding her small fist and cried out wrongfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum! I said yes! &quot; Shopkeeper Wang looked at Su Xin and said with a sneer, &ldquo;boy, please take out another jade bracelet for me, or I will report to the official now, and you will go to the prison to have a meal!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boss Wang is the most experienced in dealing with people like Su Xin.</p>
<p>As long as the government frightens them, they will be obedient.</p>
<p>The eight character yamen opens to the south. If you have no money, don&rsquo;t come in.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the government has not prepared for the poor.</p>
<p>But to Wang&rsquo;s surprise, he didn&rsquo;t see any confusion in Su Xin&rsquo;s eyes. The young man was so calm all the time.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Su Xin finally said, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t eaten prison food, but I believe you won&rsquo;t be able to eat soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you threaten me Shopkeeper Wang sneered: &ldquo;do you know the flying eagle sect? I pay dozens of money to the flying eagle Gang every month. Believe it or not, as soon as I open my mouth, you will be broken by the people of the flying eagle gang and thrown out! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lao Huang, you come in.&rdquo; Suxin called softly.</p>
<p>Hearing Su Xin&rsquo;s words, Huang Bingcheng immediately came in with eight gang members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yo! Why are you here, Mr. Huang? &quot; Seeing Huang Bingcheng come in, shopkeeper Wang immediately trotted across with thick short legs.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng has been in the flying eagle gang for more than ten years.</p>
<p>Before, when Liu Sandao was in charge, he believed that although sun and his brother had been following him all the time, the work of collecting money should be handed over to Huang Bingcheng, an experienced veteran.</p>
<p>So manager Wang is familiar with him. When the flying eagle Gang just occupied the joyful forest, he also gave Huang Bingcheng several liang of silver. Please take care of his shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, boss?&rdquo; Huang Bingcheng did not look at the shopkeeper Wang, but bowed his head and asked SuXin respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old&hellip; Boss! &quot; Shopkeeper Wang suddenly lost his mind.</p>
<p>Is this young man from the flying eagle Gang? And Huang Bingcheng, such an old man of flying eagle sect, would call him boss!</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng looked at the shopkeeper Wang coldly: &ldquo;now I&rsquo;d like to introduce you again. My eldest brother, Su Xin, is the son of the third eldest tiger. He&rsquo;s a new leader who is in charge of joyful forest.</p>
<p>You are very capable, fat Wang. Blackmail hit my eldest brother. Are you tired of living</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Wang was sweating. His short legs were shaking, couldn&rsquo;t support his fat body.</p>
<p>They are not afraid of the government for merchants with small assets like him.</p>
<p>If the government find trouble with them. It&rsquo;s just a matter of spending money.</p>
<p>What they can&rsquo;t stir up most is the flying eagle gang.</p>
<p>Business is about harmony. When you meet this kind of aggressive Gang, they have 10000 ways to kill you.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t die, you can&rsquo;t get along here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss Su, I don&rsquo;t know Taishan. Please forgive me this time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Wang cried and immediately returned the bracelet to Su Xin. He also attached a silver note with great vision. Su Xin glanced at it, no less than 300 Liang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare you? Ha ha. &quot; Su Xin chuckled and walked out of the shop with a smile.</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Wang was so annoyed by Su Xin&rsquo;s smile that he didn&rsquo;t understand what he meant.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng chased out, his eyes showed a trace of ruthlessness, and asked in a low voice, &ldquo;boss, do you want to kill this fat man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Huang Bingcheng is flattering in front of Su Xin, he is also a character who has been in the flying eagle gang for more than ten years. Although he is not very good at fighting, he has also killed people.</p>
<p>Su Xin shook his head and said softly, &ldquo;the old man hasn&rsquo;t lived for many years. It&rsquo;s too cruel to kill. Let&rsquo;s beat him to maimed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why. Hearing Su Xin&rsquo;s bland words, Huang Bingcheng suddenly felt a chill rising from his heart.</p>
<p>He nodded and walked back into the shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come here!&rdquo; cried manager Wang! What are you doing!? If you dare to move me, the government will not spare you! Ah! &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin slaps Su Xin&rsquo;er on the head and covers her ears to prevent her from hearing the scream of manager Wang.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng felt his chin and said, &ldquo;OK, stop fighting, and then he will die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing what he said, the eight gang members stopped.</p>
<p>Looking at some medicine shop assistants in the corner, Huang Bingcheng said with a sneer, &ldquo;bandage the fat man. Don&rsquo;t let him die. If the government comes here later, how can you say you should know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several guys nodded their heads, and with their two courage, they didn&rsquo;t dare to provoke the flying eagle gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xiner, let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin picks up Xin&rsquo;er and puts the bracelet in her hand, but there is a doubt in her heart.</p>
<p>The style and material of this bracelet are also very good, which is not what the Su family can have.</p>
<p>But Su Xin&rsquo;s impression of her body when she was a child has already been blurred, even better than Xin&rsquo;er remembering it clearly.</p>
<p>Asked Xin&rsquo;er two sentences, she also did not understand, Su Xin was lucky not to ask.</p>
<p>Settle Xin&rsquo;er at home and arrange for someone to take care of her. Su Xin asks Huang Bingcheng, &ldquo;Lao Huang, gather the owners of all the shops in the joyful forest to discuss affairs in zuiyue building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also has a main task to earn ten thousand liang of silver. The money still needs to be fished out in this happy forest.</p>
<p>However, he Suxin is not Liu Sandao. Of course, he will not search for those businessmen and bosses when he dies.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng has a clear look at his words.</p>
<p>New officials must do something. Before, when Liu Sandao was on the top, they were filial.</p>
<p>Now, Su Xin is the boss. If they don&rsquo;t give some blood, do they want to stay in joyful forest in the future?</p>
<p>Seeing Huang Bingcheng&rsquo;s expression, Su Xin knew what he was thinking, but he didn&rsquo;t correct it. Anyway, he would understand it by then.</p>
