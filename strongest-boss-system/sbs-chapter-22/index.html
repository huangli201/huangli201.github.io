  <h2>chapter22 Intrigue and lottery</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>On the way back, Master Li learned from Third master tiger what had happened in Main Hall, and he could not help but pat his thighs.</p>
<p>Su Xin played this trick, ah, the hard life is to turn the trial meeting against him into a game of fighting for power and profit within the Flying Eagle Gang.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Su Xin did not distinguish for himself, but put himself in a hero position who did not hesitate to fight with green bamboo gang for the sake of his brother.</p>
<p>Although some people certainly do not believe this, but as long as Lin Fuhu, the simple-minded well-developed Hall Master believed, he will naturally help Suxin speak.</p>
<p>From the moment Lin Fuhu opened his mouth, it had nothing to do with Su Xin, but turned into an infighting at Three Great Hall Lords.</p>
<p>Lin Fuhu has old grievances with Dong Chengwu. As long as Dong Chengwu opposes it, he must support it.</p>
<p>And Dong Chengwu to Good Deeds Hall, blocked Zhuang Li&rsquo;s financial road, so this Hall Lord Zhuang will not consider what right and wrong, certainly also want to stand on the opposite of Dong Chengwu.</p>
<p>A simple scene, but the three Flying Eagle Gang Hall Master are calculated in which, Li Shiye more and more think of the more clever, and even can not help applauding.</p>
<p>But looking at the gloomy expression of his benefactor Third master tiger, Mr. Li could only follow him without saying a word.</p>
<p>Before Third master tiger secretly to Su Xin to make a small move, just anxious to get rid of the relationship with Su Xin, this relationship between the righteous father and son, the difference is to tear the skin, now Su Xin nothing, Third master tiger can be happy.</p>
<p>Master Li vaguely felt that the third master had taken a bad move.</p>
<p>For Suxin, such a promising young man, if he supports him, he can still get some benefits in the future by virtue of his status as a righteous father, but he has chosen to suppress it, which is not easy to do.</p>
<p>At the same time, Huang Bingcheng, who followed Su Xin back to Happy Forest, was a cold sweat in his head.</p>
<p>He did not see a confrontation within the Main Hall, but just listening to Su Xin&rsquo;s description, he was frightened. If he had stood in the position of Su Xin, not to mention talking, I am afraid his feet would have been soft a long time ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, boss, you are so bold that you dare to act in front of the master and the three masters. What if the master can see it?&rdquo; Huang Bingcheng had a frightened expression on his face.</p>
<p>Su Xin shook his head and said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not just in case you see it, but that Gang Master already saw it. It should be said that the people present at that time, except Lin Fuhu, who had lived most of his life, still lacked a string in his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although I am very confident in my acting skills, I can&rsquo;t hide it from the sand flying eagle who founded Flying Eagle Gang, and I can&rsquo;t hide it from Dong Chengwu and Zhuang Li. &quot;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng was immediately dumbfounded: &ldquo;look.&rdquo; You see that? Then why is Gang Master talking to you? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;to correct one thing, Gang Master is not talking to me, he is talking to Lin Fu Hu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin explained: &ldquo;Lin Fuhu and Dong Chengwu had a dispute, Zhuang Li also added fuel to the side, as Gang Master, he must choose one side, if and mud, will only attract the dissatisfaction of both sides at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what if Gang Master helps Dong Chengwu speak?&rdquo; Huang Bingcheng asked.</p>
<p>Su Xin shook his head. &ldquo;No, Gang Master will certainly help Lin Fu Hu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;because among Three Great Hall Lords, only Lin Fu Hu is Gang Master&rsquo;s confidant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does Lin Fuhu have the strongest War Hall? in the gang?&rdquo; Su Shin said in a deep voice. Because he&rsquo;s the best? No, it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s the shallowest in the Three Great Hall Lords, and it&rsquo;s best to control it! &quot;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng was stunned. Although he claimed to be inquired about by Flying Eagle Gang, it was the first time he had heard of Su Xin&rsquo;s remarks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the importance of, War Hall as the strongest fighting force of Flying Eagle Gang is self-evident, so War Hall, must be managed by a reliable person.</p>
<p>In Three Great Hall Lords, Zhuang Li is slippery, and the city government is also very deep, Gang Master will not rest assured. And Dong Chengwu although the appearance of iron selfless, but his heart is how to think, no one knows.</p>
<p>Only Lin Fu Hu is a typical well-developed and simple-minded figure.</p>
<p>Although his ability is not the strongest, but the sand flying eagle is the most assured him, because he is much easier to control than the first two.</p>
<p>You once said that Dong Chengwu had publicly abolished a criminal gang rules of the battle, Gang Master did not come out to stop, that shows that he was on the side of Dong Chengwu.</p>
<p>And this time the two conflict again, if, Gang Master still speaks for Dong Chengwu, it will certainly make Lin Fu Hu cold, so this time, he must stand on Lin Fu Hu&rsquo;s side. &quot;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng suddenly speechless, he found that the most powerful Su boss is not martial arts, but how to think about the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>But in fact, Su Xin still did not say that the premise of all this is to have strength, if there is no strength, even if there are no more calculations, it is in vain.</p>
<p>This time, if he did not kill Dai Chong, the assassination failed to run back, no matter how many excuses are useless.</p>
<p>Instead, he killed Dai Chong and let green bamboo gang lose an arm, which greatly damaged green bamboo gang strength.</p>
<p>At this time, if green bamboo gang goes to war with Flying Eagle Gang again, it will not be neck and neck, but will fall behind.</p>
<p>So Su Xin&rsquo;s hand, in fact, as Ji Gang they imagined, to help bring trouble.</p>
<p>The main thing about Su Xin is whether he violates the gang rules and whether he should be punished.</p>
<p>This is the only point that is much easier to do, and it will all be solved in one scene.</p>
<p>But there are disadvantages.</p>
<p>Gang Master Sha Feiying and Dong Chengwu obviously remember him Suxin, and the next time he wants to act, it won&rsquo;t be so easy.</p>
<p>After returning to the happy forest, when he learned that Su Xin had nothing to do with it, his helpers cheered at once.</p>
<p>After this incident, the cohesion of Su Xin&rsquo;s men has been greatly enhanced.</p>
<p>It is not easy to follow a rich boss, and it is even more difficult to follow a boss who is willing to stand up for his men.</p>
<p>So everyone was very happy to see Su Xin return safely, except for Ji Gang, of course.</p>
<p>Su Xin ignored him.</p>
<p>Ji Gang is a person of Third master tiger, now Su Xin and Third master tiger have not tore their face, as long as he does not go too far, Su Xin will not touch him.</p>
<p>While everyone was happy, throwing out 100 silver, Su Xin took everyone directly to a restaurant and drank it until dark.</p>
<p>But as soon as he entered the door, Su Xin was pushed out by Xiner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, you stink. Why do you drink so much when you have nothing to do? Take a bath first, and don&rsquo;t enter the door until it&rsquo;s clean! &quot; Xiner pinched her small nose with an expression of dislike on her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;all right, I&rsquo;ll go right away.&rdquo; Su Xin had to take a bath with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Xin er didn&rsquo;t have so many problems when she lived in Changle block&rsquo;s shabby house, but now that she has moved to her new home, the little girl&rsquo;s love of cleanliness is highlighted.</p>
<p>Usually, when there was a stain on Su Xin&rsquo;s clothes, he would be hard-ripped off by Xiner.</p>
<p>When the hot water was burned and poured into the tub, Su Xin jumped in and hummed with satisfaction.</p>
<p>Although this day did not fight with people, but with the Flying Eagle Gang senior executives who acted for a day, this mental stress is also very tired.</p>
<p>After all, there are very few simple-minded guys like Lin Fuhu. These old men who have lived for decades are no worse off than their Scheming bosses in previous lives. If they are wrong, they may get caught.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the bath, Su Xin&rsquo;s spirit entered the system space.</p>
<p>Originally, Su Xin was going to accumulate some more lottery opportunities to be drawn together, or to accumulate a high-level lottery directly.</p>
<p>However, the war with Dai Chong let Su Xin feel that his strength is still very insufficient, he now urgently needs to improve his strength, accumulating more than three months in exchange for the senior lottery is somewhat unrealistic.</p>
<p>What may happen in the past three months? it is the most important thing to improve your strength for the time being.</p>
<p>In the foggy system space, Su Xin asked, &ldquo;how many raffles do I have now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;there are now 35 primary lottery opportunities and 1 intermediate lottery opportunity for the host,&rdquo; the system said. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;change it into three intermediate raffles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The probability of getting something good in the primary lottery is too low. Now Suxin needs a level of skill similar to Jing&rsquo;s lifeless fast sword, rather than a low-level method of less than two stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;the exchange has been successful. Will the host carry out the extraction now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;extract and remove the empty option.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the big screen in the middle, the roulette rotates slowly, and the pointer slides over the column of kung fu and turns to Dan medicine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to the host on drawing a bottle of Kailing San and rating two stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A white porcelain bottle appeared in front of Su Xin, and a paragraph of introduction naturally appeared in Su Xin&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kailing Powder, clear the mind and bright eyes, resolving blood and nourishing qi, suitable for the acquired martial arts to temper true qi, long-term use for the promotion of innate a little help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin took a look at the medicine bottle: &ldquo;the chicken rib is a little bit, the effect is good, but need to take for a long time, otherwise with that Yang Qi Dan effect is also similar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;continue to extract, or remove the empty option.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roulette began to turn again, and this time it finally turned to the Dharma column, as Su Xin thought.</p>
<p>A middle-aged beggar in rags appeared on the big screen.</p>
<p>But although the clothes are broken, but they are very clean, and the appearance is elegant and elegant, not like a beggar, but like a scholar of reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to the host for drawing a full view of the characters, bringing their own method of&rdquo; broken dog stick method &ldquo;, there is no need to carry out extraction, the level of performance evaluation of half a star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin almost spurted out his old blood.</p>
<p>What are you doing when you get half a star in an intermediate lottery?</p>
<p>If this is luck, but the whole view is also the elders of the gang, worth half a star?</p>
<p>Su Xin wanted to protest, but as soon as he made a noise, he shut up.</p>
<p>The Jinpai martial arts originally belong to the low-wushu world, and since the appearance of the Qing Dynasty, most of them have been using intrigue, but this martial arts is really a piece of slag.</p>
<p>But there is also a point Suxin dissatisfied, hit the dog stick method to hit the dog stick method, but also broken, what&rsquo;s the matter with this? Su Xin immediately protested.</p>
<p>The system explained: &ldquo;the method of hitting a dog stick is an unlearned method, and ordinary disciples can do it, but it is only a remnant. Although Quan Guanqing is an elder of the gang, he is still not qualified to learn the full version of the method of hitting a dog stick, so it is a broken version.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This situation will also have other methods, such as Jiuyin authentic grade evaluation of four stars, if the host draws Ouyang wind, then can only get the reverse version of Jiuyin true meridian, grade evaluation of three stars. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin smiles bitterly, the rules made by this system are really impeccable, and there is no chance of giving people a chance to detect leaks.</p>
