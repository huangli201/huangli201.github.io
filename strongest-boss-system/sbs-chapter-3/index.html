  <h2> If you want to destroy it, you must  make it crazy  first</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Changning Prefecture 49 Blocks, although Long Music Block is the poorest Fang City, but it is not all slums. At least one street is pretty good. It is called Happy Forest.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, Happy Forest is a place where people are happy,On a small street, there are hundreds of gambling halls, restaurants, brothels, and inn.</p>
<p>With this Happy Forest, you can feed dozens of Gangsters from Flying Eagle Gang.Without it, I&rsquo;m afraid Flying Eagle Gang will quit Long Music Block directly.</p>
<p>In order to fight against green bamboo gang in such a poor place, flying eagle Gang feels loss.</p>
<p>At the moment, Liu Sandao is squinting his eyes and enjoying the massage of two girls in the brothel drunk moon building of happy forest biggest, listening to several subordinates report the situation to him. It&rsquo;s very comfortable.</p>
<p>Liu Sandao has been over 30 years this year, and Jianghu, who has been mixing for more than a decade, has only come to this position of Little Chieftain.It&rsquo;s not easy.</p>
<p>Although his position is not so glorious.</p>
<p>But here is Jianghu. Although these little gangsters are only the lowest level Jianghu people, one rule is universal, that is, the winner is king.</p>
<p>Though Liu Sandao was fierce and cruel enough, he even killed a member of the rival gang face in the first war,He won the name Liu Sandao, but he is not Martial Artist.He didn&rsquo;t even have a little gongfu | effort on his body.</p>
<p>Because of his strength, he has been fighting at the lowest level of Flying Eagle Gang for more than a decade.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not without any benefit, at least in Flying Eagle Gang&rsquo;s lowest level, he has extensive contacts, and has some friendship with Little Chieftain and Great Chieftain.</p>
<p>Otherwise, after he framed Su Xin, it wasn&rsquo;t the Little Chieftain&rsquo;s position waiting for him, but Gang Rules&rsquo; disposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was Brother Chen playing at Gambling Hall?&rdquo; Liu Sandao asked indifferently, playing with a pair of iron balls in his hand.</p>
<p>He learned this from Chief Butou Tie Wuqing of Changning Prefecture Eastern 12 Blocks.He felt very imposing.</p>
<p>The subordinate frowned and said, &ldquo;Brother Chen has lost hundreds .Just now Gambling Hall lent him another hundred .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liu Sandao waved casually: &ldquo;how much I lose is on my account,Tell old Huang of gamble hall that next month&rsquo;s money will be free. &quot;</p>
<p>The subordinate very cautiously said: &ldquo;but the money for a month is only 50 Liang,And Old Huang said that when green bamboo Gang tubes were used,The money is only 30 yuan. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liu Sandao slammed iron balls in his hand to the ground.The two girls behind him suddenly turned pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liu Sandao&rsquo;s face was full of ferocity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back and tell Old Huang that in the future, the monthly money will rise to 200 yuan! If you don&rsquo;t pay it, there is no need for him to open the gambling hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! I will tell him！” The subordinate ran out at once.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why, since becoming Little Chieftain, this amiable brother Liu San has changed a lot.</p>
<p>Liu Sandao picked up the iron balls on the ground and kneaded them on the chair again, but before he could sit still, there was a lot of noise outside the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; Liu Sandao said displeased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big bro! Old Fifth is dead!&rdquo; A gangster with a scar on his face ran in with a crying cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on? Didn&rsquo;t Old Fifth go out with Old Fourth?Is it done by the people of green bamboo gang? &quot;</p>
<p>Liu Sandao pushed the crowd aside and saw the door of drunk moon building,Old fourth is carrying the old fifth who was killed by Su Xin&rsquo;s sword, and looks at him  in a daze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did Old Fifth die ?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although there are many subordinate gangster, most of them are new ones after he became little chief,Genuine followed him faithfully for several years, only these five brothers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Third brother! It&rsquo;s Old Fifth killed by Su Xin!&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Su Xin！” The last thing Liu Sandao wants to hear right now is the name.</p>
<p>Jianghu Gang faction is not ashamed of Orthodox Dao Martial World, but it also needs to give a lecture.</p>
<p>Liu Sandao got this position by setting up brother,Although we have settled down, it is hard to avoid being gossiped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible! Su Xin had been hit by the green bamboo gang and almost dead now, how could it kill Old Fifth? &quot;</p>
<p>Old Fourth said tragically: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s true! Su Xin killed Old Fifth with just one sword! No! Can&rsquo;t say the sword he used,Can only be regarded as a piece of iron! He also said that third brother you owe him,He will personally ask you for it! &quot;</p>
<p>Hearing this, Liu Sandao felt a chill rush to the top of his head.</p>
<p>Looking around, Liu Sandao shouted, &ldquo;what the hell are you looking at? Get out of here! &quot;</p>
<p>The crowd watching Drunk Moon Building suddenly retracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me Brother Chen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother Chen was originally named Chen Dao. He was in his 40s, although he was just an ordinary gangster from the Flying Eagle Gang.But his other identity is the recommended son of Third Master tiger, one of the 13 great leaders of flying eagle gang.</p>
<p>The gongfu | effort of Iron Sand Palm won the true biography of Third Master Tiger, and the ordinary Little Chieftain was not his opponent at all.</p>
<p>This time Liu Sandao invited Chen Dao to come and eat, drink, express and gamble.I spent several hundred liang of silver just to make him say something in front of the third master tiger,To make your position more stable.</p>
<p>Subordinate invited Chen Dao over, but Chen Dao sat impatiently at Liu Sandao&rsquo;s previous position and asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? I&rsquo;m happy over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liu Sandao didn&rsquo;t care about Chen Dao&rsquo;s rudeness at all, but instead laughed: &ldquo;Brother Chen,It&rsquo;s like this. My subordinate was killed in one move,So I want you to have a look at the strength of that man. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People of green bamboo gang?&rdquo; In places like Long Music Block, no other gang faction will come. The only possibility is the green bamboo gang who just lost a battle with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s our own Flying Eagle Gang.Liu Sandao&rsquo;s awkward look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself? fuck, you can&rsquo;t even control your own subordinate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Dao frowned at Liu Sandao, suddenly thought of something, and asked in surprise, &ldquo;is that Su Xin? Su Xin, who was robbed of his position by you? &quot;</p>
<p>Liu Sandao nodded awkwardly, after all, betrayed something like brother.</p>
<p>Chen Dao shrugged indifferently, he was paying someone to solve a problem anyway.</p>
<p>Old Fifth&rsquo;s body was brought up, and Chen Dao squatted down and began to explore it carefully.</p>
<p>Seeing the sword wound in old fifth&rsquo;s throat,Chen Dao&rsquo;s eyes flickered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother Chen, how about that? Can you see anything?&rdquo; Liu Sandao asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Expert! An expert using sword!&rdquo; Chen Dao said in a deep voice, and his tone was no longer lazy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fatal blow, the sword edge cut the throat accurately, not even a centimeter away. This person&rsquo;s control of the sword has reached the level of terrifying. Su Xin was so strong when you were subordinate ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liu Sandao said in a daze, &ldquo;This kid was really good at fight,Don&rsquo;t look at his weakness, but he has strength.Coupled with take action very ruthless, it is not a problem to single out three strong men,But I haven&rsquo;t heard that he can use sword. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange that people who have not immersed in sword Dao for more than ten years cannot use this method.Chen Dao sat up, playing with Liu Sandao&rsquo;s iron balls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that Su Xin has learned internal merit?&rdquo; Said Liu Sandao suddenly.</p>
<p>Chen Dao sneered: &ldquo;Who do you think is qualified to learn internal merit?Only the Martial Artist of the genuine Houtian realm will be internal merit,We have sand Eagle Gang, and only Gang Lord and three Hall Lord are the martial artists of Houtian realm.</p>
<p>Where do you think this is? This is Changning city, not Shengjing City, which is full of martial artists,Our top sky is a Jianghu run, and internal merit,Did you listen to a lot of  books?</p>
<p>Liu Sandao grinned: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lil &lsquo;bro I ignore and ill-informed,Brother Chen, are you sure about Su Xin? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of the quicker and more accurate stabs? Power is fundamental! 500 pairs of white silver, let me help you solve Su Xin.At the same time I will report adopted father that this Su Xin colluded with green bamboo gang,Take you out of the rumors that set up brother.Chen Dao said while playing with Liu Sandao&rsquo;s iron balls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;OK! I&rsquo;m going to prepare the silver! &quot; Liu Sandao promised to bite his teeth.</p>
<p>Compared with silver, life is still important, though more than 500,Take a closer look at each store in Happy Forest.It&rsquo;s out in a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy! Liu Sandao, you will soon know,You&rsquo;ve spent 500 silver well spent</p>
<p>Chen Dao throws down iron balls and gets up. On the iron balls made of pure steel, five clear finger marks appear!</p>
<p>What is Su Xin doing now? He is eating steamed buns.</p>
<p>As soon as he reached Happy Forest, he felt hungry again, so he found a roadside stall and ordered several cages of steamed dumpling to eat.</p>
<p>Martial Artist qi and blood is full, so the appetite is very large, plus Su Xin has just studied internal merit,It is even more necessary to digest the essence of food to refining into internal force.</p>
<p>Some experts, a solar eclipse is also normal,Of course, people can also do not eat or drink in January.</p>
<p>After eating the buns, Su Xin suddenly remembered that he had not used lottery draw again today.</p>
<p>Su Xin appeared in the System space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;System, do I have another chance to lottery draw today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>System said: &ldquo;Yes, the host has another chance for Low Grade Lottery Draw. May you draw it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extraction.&rdquo; Su Xin said without hesitation.</p>
<p>Although Low Grade Lottery Draw compares chicken ribs (little value), it&rsquo;s good to pull a merit law or martial skill again in case of a bad luck.</p>
<p>But this time Su Xin is obviously not covered by lucky halo,The pointer of the wheel skimmed merit law and turned to pill medicine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! There is some gap with imagination,If only weapon would be fine. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin now uses the iron flake sword, which is a bit shabby.</p>
<p>The silver he had brought from Old Fourth would have bought a fine steel long sword, but it was all ordinary, almost as good as iron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulations to the host for drawing a Low Grade Inferior Quality Raising Qi Pill and evaluating Half-Star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s mouth twitched. Low Grade Raising Qi Pill, or Inferior Quality, is not a good thing to listen to names.</p>
<p>From the system space, the low grade inferior quality raining Qi pill appeared in Su Xin&rsquo;s hands,Not spherical, but irregular.Doesn&rsquo;t look very reliable.</p>
<p>Su Xin opened his mouth and swallowed it.I instantly felt that the internal force in my body had doubled.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a lot of times. Su Xin is just an internal merit that has been cultivated for a day,The internal force in the body is only that small, even if it doubles.It&rsquo;s just a trace.</p>
<p>In summary, this Low Grade Inferior Quality Raising Qi Pill can only increase the internal force cultivate by Su Xin a day,Chat is better than nothing.</p>
<p>Just standing up, the voice of System emerged from Su Xin&rsquo;s mind: &ldquo;The Quest System is on,Now publish quest.Novice Quest: kill Liu Sandao in three days and become flying eagle Gang little chief. Quest reward: villain points10 points,Low Grade Raising Qi Pill.Failure Penalty: Broken arm. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Novice Quest&rsquo;s Failure Penalty is so heavy?But Quest is simple.</p>
<p>Su Xin throws down a piece of silver and goes straight to the happy forest.</p>
