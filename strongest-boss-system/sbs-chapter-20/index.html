  <h2>chapter20 Interrogation</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Sunyi blockã€‚</p>
<p>Walking on the street with Dai Chong&rsquo;s head, Huang Bingcheng felt awkward.</p>
<p>The moment before is still the majestic green bamboo gang big leader, this moment actually was packed in the box, becomes someone&rsquo;s trophy, this kind of feeling lets Huang Bingcheng some inexplicable sigh.</p>
<p>Looking at the front of the stable Su Xin, Huang Bingcheng really can not think of, this boss how to get so much self-confidence.</p>
<p>Last night he was so worried that he could not sleep all night for fear of being severely punished by the top brass of the gang.</p>
<p>But when I got up in the morning to look at Su Xin, he looked refreshed.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng, who was out of his mind, followed Su Xin to the mansion in Third master tiger. Master Li was already waiting for them at the door.</p>
<p>Looking at Su Xin, Mr. Li&rsquo;s eyes are very complicated.</p>
<p>The first time we met, Su Xin left an impression on Master Li that his mind was so unfathomable that he simply did not look like a young man under the age of twenty.</p>
<p>As a assistant of Third master tiger, Master Li has always relied on his brain to live, and he is not used to fighting and killing the game.</p>
<p>The last time Su Xin bribed him to get the news, Mr. Li kept thinking about how he would break the game.</p>
<p>But no matter how he could not imagine, Su Xin used the simplest way to break the game: kill!</p>
<p>&ldquo;unfortunately, if the young man can endure this hurdle and endure his qualifications, he will definitely go farther than the third Master in the future, but this time he has taken a bad move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master Li thought to himself, but with a bright smile on his face, &ldquo;is Master Su here?&rdquo; The third master is already waiting for you in there. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin nodded and followed Mr. Li into the living room.</p>
<p>In the living room.</p>
<p>Third master tiger&rsquo;s face sank like water. Mr. Li led Su Xin in and stood aside.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng saw it and hurriedly stood beside him.</p>
<p>The two sides were silent for a while, but Su Xin was the first to open his mouth: &ldquo;the child pays homage to the godfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;and you know I&rsquo;m your godfather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Third master tiger slapped the table, which was made of gold nanmu, and was photographed directly by him with a thorough handprint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what did I say last time? Tell you not to cause trouble, do not cause trouble, just pretend it never happened, you are glad to run to assassinate Dai Chong! Do you know, now because of you, Flying Eagle Gang is about to  turned upside down! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Father. I killed the man. When I get to the gang, I will naturally explain it to the gang master and will not be implicated in you.&rdquo; Su Xin smiled slightly, but in the depths of his smile, he sketched out a touch of sarcasm.</p>
<p>Why is Third master tiger so angry? It is not yet afraid that Su Xin&rsquo;s actions will affect him.</p>
<p>In name, Su Xin is the righteous son of Third master tiger. How can, Flying Eagle Gang not blame Third master tiger? for doing such a big thing?</p>
<p>&ldquo;am I afraid you&rsquo;ll implicate me? I&rsquo;m angry and indisputable! Keep a good day, but if you have to make trouble, I&rsquo;ll see how you end up this time! &quot;</p>
<p>Third master tiger snorted a cold hum, the color of anger in the eyes is less, but reappear, but it is deep fear and regret!</p>
<p>Yes, now Third master tiger has some regrets, regret that he did not directly abolish Suxin, and chose to let him replace Chen to become his righteous son.</p>
<p>At first, Su Xin spoke skillfully and said that Chen would threaten his position, but now, Third master tiger feels the threat of Su Xin!</p>
<p>Only more than a month, Suxin has grown to this point.</p>
<p>If you want money, you have money.If you want people, you have people.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Su Xin still has the strength!</p>
<p>Dai Chong&rsquo;s strength, Third master tiger knows, is definitely much better than him.</p>
<p>Born powerful Dai Chong strength is not inferior to the begining of HouTian Realm martial arts, in the whole green bamboo gang, Dai Chong can rank in the top five, but now Su Xin cut off his head, swaggering to here.</p>
<p>In the past, Su Xin said that Chen would one day threaten his position, but now Su Xin already has the strength to threaten himself!</p>
<p>&ldquo;come on, master, they are all waiting for you. I am afraid it will not be good for you to make such a big mistake this time, but at least you will call me my godfather, and I will try my best to keep you safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Third master tiger spoke in a high-sounding manner, but from the bottom of his heart he had sentenced Su Xin to death.</p>
<p>This time he made so much trouble that he alarmed the Old Sect Master, who had been out of charge for a long time, and the punishment would never be light.</p>
<p>This kind of event in the position of Third master tiger, there is no word at all, and even if he can speak, he will only put aside his own relationship, by the way, get rid of the threat of Su Xin.</p>
<p>Changning House 49 Square, Flying Eagle Gang General Hall mouth is the most prosperous Jin Yuefang in the East Twelve Square.</p>
<p>The whole hall covers an area of more than ten mu, about half a street that big, appears to be extremely dignified.</p>
<p>Suxin that small hall mouth in Huang Bingcheng&rsquo;s view is very prestigious, but compared with this Flying Eagle Gang hall, it is a little small.</p>
<p>Tangkou main entrance, two more than two tall eagle stone carvings stand on both sides of the door, instead of the gatekeeper stone lion, this is also the characteristic of Flying Eagle Gang.</p>
<p>The guards on both sides of the hall mouth are all dressed in a black samurai suit, the left chest embroidered with a Shenjun eagle, waist machete.</p>
<p>Su Xin squinted at the crowd and found some differences.</p>
<p>Now the gangs under Su Xin, as well as those under Third master tiger, say nicely that they are gangsters, but in fact, most of them are street gangsters, like Li Huai, who have real kung fu, few of whom have real kung fu.</p>
<p>And now these eyes are fierce, with a trace of if there is no murderous gas, each strong body, full of qi and blood, a look is to kill people, to see the blood of the elite.</p>
<p>Seeing the look in Su Xin&rsquo;s eyes, Master Li whispered, &ldquo;these are the elites of the disciple, Flying Eagle Gang of the War Hall, but there are no more than a hundred people in our whole Flying Eagle Gang,.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin nodded and understood the framework of Flying Eagle Gang&rsquo;s power.</p>
<p>Flying Eagle Gang in addition to the 13 big leaders, only the second Gang Master Yu is the three church masters.</p>
<p>The three separate halls are the Good Deeds Hall in charge of money, the  Punishment hall in charge of criminal , and the War Hall  in charge of the strongest fighting force in the gang.</p>
<p>These three lords are far above the thirteen big leaders and are the true rulers of the Flying Eagle Gang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you stay outside.&rdquo; Third master tiger said to Mr. Li and Huang Bingcheng.</p>
<p>The Flying Eagle Gang auditorium is not accessible to anyone who wants to.</p>
<p>Mr. Li, an aide to Third master tiger, is not qualified to go in, let alone Huang Bingcheng, an ordinary gang.</p>
<p>In the hall, which was large enough to hold a hundred people, a long ten-foot table was placed in the middle, with three on the left and twelve on the right, with an old man on the head.</p>
<p>When Third master tiger came in with Su Xin, everyone&rsquo;s eyes looked at him for a moment, which immediately made Su Xin feel a solemn pressure.</p>
<p>The people present, that can be the real Flying Eagle Gang in power, used more than a decade of time to kill the Flying Eagle Gang this family business, everyone&rsquo;s momentum, is as cold as a knife.</p>
<p>Especially the Flying Eagle Gang master, Shafei Eagle, who sits on the throne.</p>
<p>Shafei eagle looks very old, looks like seventy or eighty years old, full of white hair, face with deep decree lines, looks a little depressed, but there is still a knife-like sharpness between the eyebrows.</p>
<p>Su Xin is very impressed by this helper, in the whole Flying Eagle Gang, sand flying eagle is the legend in the hearts of many young helpers.</p>
<p>It is said that the sand eagle was a man of Changning House from an early age, and in his early years, his family was still a big family of Changning House, but because he offended a strong man, the door was destroyed, and he was the only one who escaped.</p>
<p>Then Sha Feiying fled Changning government on Jiang Hu, he is said to have joined Taihang copycat, become a giant aggressor across Henan Province.</p>
<p>Others say that he went to the Western regions and killed countless people by robbing them between the thirty-six kingdoms of the Western regions and the Xiliang Road.</p>
<p>Anyway, twenty years later, the middle-aged sand eagle came back.</p>
<p>With a body of martial arts and killing back to Changning House, his enemies were killed, and the establishment of Flying Eagle Gang, became one of the largest forces in Changning House.</p>
<p>This kind of prince vengeance and the like, one of the young people like to hear, as for the true or false, who knows?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, Su Xin has already arrived.&rdquo; Third master tiger Arch his hand at the sand eagle with great respect.</p>
<p>Sha Fei Eagle did not speak, but waved his hand and immediately went to the big leader&rsquo;s side to sit down, looking at the nose, nose and mouth, motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;are you Su Xin?&rdquo; Sand flying eagle mouth, voice old and hoarse, like sand and gravel friction in general.</p>
<p>Su Xin point, respectfully bent down to salute the crowd: &ldquo;Su Xin has seen the master, all the elders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The people at Flying Eagle Gang looked at Su Xin, and apart from anything else, the young man had a lot of courage.</p>
<p>If it were ordinary helpers, under the gaze of all the top executives of the Flying Eagle Gang, I am afraid they would have been trembling and unable to help themselves.</p>
<p>But this Su Xin is very indifferent, the courage is enough.</p>
<p>But in other words, if you don&rsquo;t have the guts, you can&rsquo;t do such a big thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Su Xin! And you know you&rsquo;re from Flying Eagle Gang? Have you ever turned a blind eye to Flying Eagle Gang after such a disaster? &quot; Dong Chengwu, the master of the criminal hall, drank in a low voice, and his voice was as awe as a knife.</p>
<p>Of the three masters, Dong Chengwu is the youngest. It seems that he is less than 50 years old, but in fact, his age is about the same as that of Third master tiger, and he is already close to 60.</p>
<p>Only because Dong Chengwu&rsquo;s martial arts practice is not weak, he appears to be younger than Third master tiger.</p>
<p>The specific strength of Su Xin can not feel, but certainly better than the begining of HouTian Realm he is much stronger.</p>
<p>As the head of the criminal hall for more than 30 years, Dong Chengwu killed more of his own people than outsiders, and ordinary helpers were afraid of the criminal hall master, even more than the gang master.</p>
