  <h2>chapter2  can kill people, is the sword!</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>The next morning, Su Xin woke up early and saw Xin&rsquo;er, who was still asleep, quietly covered her with a quilt.</p>
<p>Opening the rice jar, Su Xin&rsquo;s heart felt a little convulsive pain when he saw the rice jar with only a dozen grains of rice inside.</p>
<p>Staggering out of the door, Su Xin planned to find something to make a sword.</p>
<p>Get Jing Wuming&rsquo;s Quick Sword, he also need to have a sword first.</p>
<p>Sliding open the door, the muddy street where the sewage flows,Low, dilapidated houses and numb pedestrians all show that,This is a slum.</p>
<p>A place so poor that even beggars are unwilling to come, but have a good name, Long Music Block.</p>
<p>Of course, this was not the case with the previous Long Music Block.</p>
<p>Changing Prefecture, the predecessor of Great Zhou Capital, has 49 City Blocks, which are thriving even if it is LongMusic Block near the edge.</p>
<p>But since 30 years ago, the literary turns into martial virtue, achievements cover a thousand years ago, Grand Martial Emperor came across the world.After Zhou state was transformed from a southern barbarans little country into the great Zhou Dynasty of hegemon country of Jin covered head and sneaked away like a rat,This Changning Prefecture did not fall.</p>
<p>After Grand Martial Emperor moved to the capital, I don&rsquo;t know if it was a hindrance to the previous small capital.  Imperial City was demolished directly and 90% of the city&rsquo;s wealthy merchant officials were moved to the new capital Shengjing. Changning Prefecture began to decline gradually.</p>
<p>Su Xin found an arm-long, three-finger-wide piece of iron in the corner, covered with rust, which was used to block the chicken nest. Unfortunately, the chickens in Su Xin&rsquo;s family have never been raised since his mother died.</p>
<p>Find two pieces of wood sandwiched between pieces of iron,Wrap it with hemp rope, this is the hilt.</p>
<p>Then Su Xin found a whetstone and began to carefully remove the rust on the iron piece to open the front for the iron piece.</p>
<p>Then the door was pushed open and Xin&rsquo;er came out sleepily.Rubbing his eyes and pouting his mouth, he asked, &ldquo;elder brother,what are you doing? &quot;</p>
<p>A slight smiling expression appeared on the corner of Su Xin&rsquo;s mouth, and said softly, &ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er obediently, the elder brother will take you to eat delicious food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This life Su Xin has a good look,Although not very handsome, but a smile is very good-looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Xin&rsquo;er will be good.&rdquo; Su Xin&rsquo;er nodded fiercely,Quietly swallowed a mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>In the past, the elder brother always took her to eat the chopped noodles made by Granny Wang.But elder brother hasn&rsquo;t taken her with him for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well? Su Xin, you&rsquo;re not dead yet? Life is big enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two wore a clean short-sleeved samurai suit, and a man with an eagle embroidered on his chest walked around, showing a startled expression.</p>
<p>Su Xin looked at their two people coldly. They were not strange to him.Three days ago, they were brothers fighting side by side.</p>
<p>Flying Eagle Gang is one of the Three Gangs, Four Unions in Changning Prefecture,In addition to Gang Lord, there are three Hall Lords.</p>
<p>Under the three Hall Lord, there are more than ten great chieftain and more than 50 little chieftain.</p>
<p>Last time I fought with green bamboo Gang, great chief has given an order. This time, whoever kills the most people will become little chief, who can manage a street of little chief.</p>
<p>Although Su Xin is young, he has some brute force in his hands.With take action very ruthless not afraid of death, I killed three gangsters of green bamboo gang,All of a sudden, the opposite side was stopped.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t expect that in the end, Liu Sandao, whom he regarded as a big bro, suddenly evacuated with several people fighting alongside him, leaving him alone in the siege of green bamboo gang and being directly killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liu Sandao has now become Little Chieftain? Doesn&rsquo;t he not ashamed of his position as a betrayer?&rdquo; If Su Xin was not betrayed, he would be the one who became the Little Chieftain by his exploits.</p>
<p>One of them shrugged and said, &ldquo;Su Xin, you are so popular. In that war, you killed the most people. If you don&rsquo;t die, third brother won&rsquo;t be the little chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hehe.&rdquo; Su Xin chuckled suddenly, wondering why.They two had a chilling feeling when they heard Su Xin&rsquo;s laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been following Liu Sandao since I joined the Flying Eagle Gang. For so many years, I have always treated him as a big bro! Even if I have the most achievements in the end, I am ready to give the position of Little Chieftain his!&rdquo;</p>
<p>“呵呵，one may know a person for a long time without understanding his true nature，Only dead people are the safest. &quot;</p>
<p>Another person pulled out the dagger around his waist, and sinister said, &ldquo;What did the Old Fourth say to you? He just killed him while he was seriously injured!</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s alive, and he&rsquo;s never had a good reputation for third brother,And his younger sister, although a little smaller, but sold to Yang State Prefecture to become a thin horse can also change a few silver tael! &quot;</p>
<p>Long Music Block&rsquo;s pedestrians weren&rsquo;t half surprised to see him shining his knife.Instead, they stopped to watch it with interest.</p>
<p>Jianghu is so cruel, especially for those in the background slums.</p>
<p>Every day, there are gang members fighting and even killing,It ’s no big deal to die one or two people.The government is too lazy to manage.</p>
<p>Su Xin stands up unsteadily, still a little frail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er, close your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;er looked at Su Xin anxiously. She knew what the elder brother did, but she closed her eyes obediently because she believed in the elder brother.</p>
<p>The man sneered dismissively: &ldquo;Why, do you still want to do it? As you are now, you thought you were Su Xin who singled out three strong men without falling into the wind? You did n’t even have a weapon, what do you take? Fight me? Just the piece of iron in your hand? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not an iron piece, it&rsquo;s a sword.&rdquo; Su Xin&rsquo;s tone was indifferent, as if he was telling a fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it a sword? Ha ha ha! Don&rsquo;t be funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one who can kill is the sword!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s left hand suddenly moved, a Sword Pierced out, the ridiculous piece of iron had been inserted into the man&rsquo;s throat.</p>
<p>Jing Wuming&rsquo;s sword is a killing sword! There is no fancy sword method, only the simplest murder technique.</p>
<p>His sword is not a martial merit, but a pure murder skill!</p>
<p>Su Xin slowly pulled the sword out of the man&rsquo;s throat,The rusty iron sheet was stained with bloody and became abnormally glamorous.</p>
<p>Everyone now believes that Su Xin is indeed a sword,A sword that can kill!</p>
<p>There was a hint of blood red in Su Xin&rsquo;s eyes, I do n’t know why,He didn&rsquo;t hesitate to kill in the first time. Seeing the spatter of blood,There was no slight discomfort.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because of the fusion of the memories of the two generations,Although Su Xin of this life is a teenager,But there are already lives on hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killing, it seems very simple.Su Xin shook the Blood Bead on his sword.It was like previous life, and he died very simply.</p>
<p>The old fourth next to me is freaking out.</p>
<p>He has known Su Xin for several years,I know that he is very good at fighting, but I have never seen such a terrifying sword method!</p>
<p>Su Xin just raised his hand, and the sword had been inserted into the human throat,Simple and direct, terrifying incomparable!</p>
<p>Old Fourth didn&rsquo;t hesitate, and immediately turned around and ran, but he suddenly felt a cold above his head, and his hair was shaved by Su Xin when he didn&rsquo;t know when!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you run again, I will kill you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old fourth turned around and knelt down for Su Xin immediately, kowtowed and said in horror: &ldquo;last time&rsquo;s matter is really none of my business,It was Liu Sandao&rsquo;s decision alone. Looking at our emotions for many years,Just spare me! &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;stand up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Fourth got up in a hurry, afraid to breathe even in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me all the silver you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Fourth quickly pulled out all his broken silver and handed it to Su Xin&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him back to Liu Sandao and tell him that he owes me Su Xin will go and find him personally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s face doesn&rsquo;t have any expression, there is no anger, but that&rsquo;s what makes old four cool from the heart.</p>
<p>The Old Fourth took the corpse away with a tow,Quickly disappeared in the alley.</p>
<p>Other Long Music Block pedestrians get busy out of the way.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;ve seen murders, but they&rsquo;re horrified to see murders as brisk as Su Xin&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er, open your eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin rubbed Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s head and said, &ldquo;Go,Wash your face and elder brother takes you to beef brisket noodles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s face suddenly showed a happy smile, for her, as long as elder brother is in, as long as there is food, she is very satisfied.</p>
<p>Granny Wang at the street set up a stall of several tens of years,Take Su Xin&rsquo;er to eat noodles here since Little Su letter.</p>
<p>Granny Wang only sells three kinds of noodles, plain noodles, mixed noodles and beef brisket noodles.</p>
<p>In the past, Su Xin only took Xin&rsquo;er to eat a bowl of noodles occasionally,Only for the holidays, can we order a beef brisket noodles.Only one serving is for Xin&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandma, two bowls of beef brisket noodles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Granny Wang filled them with two bowls of soup and red beef brisket noodles, and specially filled Xin&rsquo;er&rsquo;s bowl with a few extra pieces of beef brisket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little darling, eat slowly.&rdquo; Granny Wang&rsquo;s Xiangchuan accent,Looking at Xin&rsquo;er eating beef brisket noodles, a flower is coming out on her wrinkled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thank you Granny Wang.&rdquo; Xin&rsquo;er couldn&rsquo;t wait to sip the noodles, thanking Granny Wang in a vague manner.</p>
<p>Su Xin gave Xin&rsquo;er the brisket in her bowl and ate noodles.</p>
<p>With the food going down, Su Xin felt that her physical strength had recovered a little, and her physical strength recovered for three days after being hungry.</p>
<p>Although Su Xin has a poor internal force due to the relationship between cultivated Quanzhen reliance primary level internal merit, this internal force is not enough to make his physical strength fully recover.</p>
<p>After eating the bowl of noodles, Su Xin saw Xin&rsquo;er, who was still wolfing down, rubbed her head gently and said to Granny Wang, &ldquo;Granny, I have something to do. Can you take care of Xin&rsquo;er first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Granny Wang waved his hand and sighed, &ldquo;boy,Jianghu is sinister, don&rsquo;t forget that there is a younger sister like little darling. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin smiled at Granny Wang,It&rsquo;s dangerous in the Jianghu. It&rsquo;s worse than people&rsquo;s heart？</p>
<p>&ldquo;Xin&rsquo;er obediently, eat noodles obediently at Granny Wang,Elder brother will be back in the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;er drummed his cheeks and nodded smartly.</p>
