  <h2>chapter15 brutal reality</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Master Happy Intention Block Third Tiger&rsquo;s house, this time Su Xin does not have to announce, the two gangster doormen directly let Su Xin and Huang Bingcheng in.</p>
<p>To be able to create such a momentum in Happy Forest, even if Su Xin is not the adopted son, of Third Tiger, they deserve their respect.</p>
<p>In the living room, third tiger is sitting on the main seat, as if knowing Su Xin is coming, and adviser Li is standing behind him.</p>
<p>“Su Xin pay respects adopted father。” Su Xin hurried forward and bowed.</p>
<p>Mr. third tiger, with a teacup in his hand, said with a smile: &ldquo;get up, I&rsquo;ve done a good job in happy forest in this period of time. My father didn&rsquo;t mistake you at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin flatteringly said: &ldquo;I still have to rely on the voice of adopted father . If adopted father were not standing behind me, I would not be able to subdue the businessmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, you don&rsquo;t have to be self-deprecating. You&rsquo;re the most capable, Happy Forest reform in the whole Flying Eagle Gang young generation, and even Gang Lord is full of praise for you.&rdquo; Said Lord Third Tiger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;by the way, adopted father, did you know that my subordinate&rsquo;s brother was killed by green bamboo gang&rsquo;s men yesterday?&rdquo; Su Xin asked.</p>
<p>Master Third Tiger said, &ldquo;of course I know that. It&rsquo;s just a misunderstanding.&rdquo; Green bamboo gang Great Chieftain Dai Chong has come to apologize and lost ten silver tael, and let it go. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin forced to bear his anger and said: &ldquo;the adopted father, he green bamboo Gang killed my brother, don&rsquo;t I fly Eagle Gang just let it go? Is an apology worth one&rsquo;s life? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what more do you want? The struggle between you and young,gang faction is not that simple. &quot; Master Third Tiger said earnestly.</p>
<p>Su Xin wanted to say something more, but, Third Tiger said directly, &ldquo;come on, your Happy Forest is just beginning to develop. Don&rsquo;t focus on such a little thing.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m tired of, Adviser Li, delivering Su Xin for me. &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as he heard this, Su Xin knew that it was really out of the question for flying eagle Gang to send someone to get justice. He had to turn around and leave with Huang Bingcheng.</p>
<p>Adviser Li followed them with a smile and said, &ldquo;Young Master Su, don&rsquo;t take this to heart either. If you don&rsquo;t give that gangster a little more burial expenses, just pretend it never happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adviser Li, don&rsquo;t call me that. Just call me by my name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white paper fan Adviser Li,Su Xin, who followed Master Third Tiger several tens of years, will not underestimate him.</p>
<p>Adviser Li shook his head: &ldquo;no, you can&rsquo;t give up the etiquette. You&rsquo;re the adored son of the third master. I call you young master. That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin looks moved, pulls adviser Li to the corner of the door, and makes a color for Huang Bingcheng.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng was also smart. He immediately took out 1000 tael of silver tickets and skillfully put them into the hands of adviser Li.</p>
<p>Adviser Li glanced at the denomination of the silver ticket and suddenly felt happy and put it in his sleeve without a trace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;cough cough,Young Master Su, that&rsquo;s very kind of you.&rdquo; Adviser Li said with a smile.</p>
<p>Su Xin arch: &ldquo;Adviser Li, I do not want to be polite to you, but really want to ask you, why green bamboo gang killed our people, and the above refused to ask them a statement?&rdquo; Is it that adopted father doesn&rsquo;t want to lose subordinate&rsquo;s brother? &quot;</p>
<p>Adviser Li looked around, looked at no one coming, and sighed, &ldquo;Young Master Su, I&rsquo;m not hiding it from you. It really doesn&rsquo;t have much to do with Master Third Tiger. It&rsquo;s all about the above decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin picked the eyebrows. It doesn&rsquo;t matter a lot. I think there are still some relations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;green bamboo gang killed our people, which is tantamount to hitting us in the face on the spot. The last time we lost the battle of Long Music Block, but they green bamboo gang, why do we have to step back and be patient this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After winning the battle, he had to pretend to be a grandson, which is what Su Xin wondered about.</p>
<p>Adviser Li shook his head and sighed, &ldquo;Young Master Su, do you know why we went to war with green bamboo gang last time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it because you&rsquo;re fighting for Long Music Block?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fart!&rdquo; said adviser Li with a disdainful grin! That&rsquo;s just an excuse to fool ordinary gangster. There&rsquo;s nothing valuable in long music block except for a happy forest.</p>
<p>Moreover, the happy forest is prosperous only after you take over. The previous happy forest can collect several hundred liang of money at the top of each month, which is not enough to reward the subordinate people after the long music block war.</p>
<p>The reason why we fought with genuine and green bamboo Gang is that young Gang Lord Sha Yuandong and green bamboo Gang&rsquo;s young Gang Lord were jealous and suffered a little loss, so we had to revenge.</p>
<p>Two gang faction went to war, losing not only gangster, but also a lot of Money.</p>
<p>After the war to reward the gangster, injured or even dead gangster also have to give a pension, the noise is too big, but also to plug the money to take care of the government, this cost is a lot of money.</p>
<p>So Long Music Block that war is simply no sense, nothing more than two Pampered Childe jealousy only.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t want to make a big deal, and green bamboo Gang didn&rsquo;t want to increase the loss, so the initiative to quit gave us a face to fly Eagle gang.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s just a little gangster. Green bamboo Gang apologized and had face. Why should they spend a lot of money to attack green bamboo gang for a justice that is not worth a penny? &quot;</p>
<p>Adviser Li&rsquo;s words stunned Su Xin and Huang Bingcheng, who did not expect that the gang faction battle more than a month ago was due to two Pampered Childe&rsquo;s jealousy.</p>
<p>I looked around at, Adviser Li and whispered, &ldquo;Young Master Su, I have one more word. I&rsquo;m not going to send someone to ask for an explanation. In addition to this reason, there&rsquo;s something about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your Happy Forest earns nearly 100,000 a month, even more than some Great Chieftain earns every month, and a lot of people are already jealous and want to crush you. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin Chen Sheng said: &ldquo;is adopted father to help me  ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The 80000 silver tael,Su Xin I earned this month gave Master Third Tiger 30000 taels.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is to honor him, and on the other hand, it is to prevent people from being jealous, so that Master Third Tiger can block it for him.</p>
<p>Nominal said that, Su Xin this Little Chieftain is under the control of Third Tiger, and Third Tiger is also his adopted father.</p>
<p>If someone wants to suppress Su Xin with red eyes, Mr. third tiger, naturally wants to help Su Xin.</p>
<p>The question adviser Li didn&rsquo;t answer positively, but asked: &ldquo;young master Su, you gave 30000 silver tael to the third master last month, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;it was only later that the third master learned that you made a total of 80000 silver taels last month!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finish the sentence, Adviser Li arch of the hand, direct and walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human heart is not enough to swallow an elephant!&rdquo; Su Xin understood the meaning of adviser Li&rsquo;s words, flashed a cold light in his eyes, and left with Huang Bingcheng directly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it! What kind of things are they! In order to fight with green bamboo gang for two pampered children, now my family is killed by green bamboo Gang, but they don&rsquo;t fart! &quot; Along the way, Huang Bingcheng was swearing and seemed extremely indignant.</p>
<p>Long Music Block that war he also took part in, although with his character, certainly will not rush up with the fight, but this matter also let him have a kind of rabbit dead fox sad feeling.</p>
<p>The top brass of Flying Eagle Gang really don&rsquo;t think of them as ordinary gangster!</p>
<p>Compared with Huang Bingcheng&rsquo;s anger, Su Xin seems to be indifferent: &ldquo;look, the only thing high-ranking people think about is two words, which is benefit.</p>
<p>Obviously, what we want to do is not in line with their Benefit, so they don&rsquo;t care, or even suppress it. It is better to rely on yourself than on others. &quot;</p>
<p>Su Xin understood this when she was in previous life, and never put her own destiny in the hands of others.</p>
<p>Master Third Tiger doesn&rsquo;t care , Flying Eagle Gang is not take action,. be Su Xin Can  still  suffocated by ?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old boss, you want to&hellip;&rdquo; Huang Bingcheng looks at Su Xin in shock.</p>
<p>Su Xin didn&rsquo;t speak, but there was a cold flash in her eyes.</p>
<p>All the way back to Happy Forest Hall, his subordinate people are waiting at anxiously, wondering if they will send someone to ask for justice for them.</p>
<p>But when they saw that only Su Xin and Huang Bingcheng, the two people, came back, their hearts thumped.</p>
<p>In front of the eyes of all the people, Su Xin said frankly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s said above that green bamboo gang has apologized. Even if this matter is over, they will not send someone to fight with green bamboo Gang again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin subordinate&rsquo;s people were excited at once. Even though they had guessed the news, they had a feeling of suffocation.</p>
<p>Ji Gang shook his head in the crowd, showing disdain in the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p>He is a confidant of Master Third Tiger, and naturally knows something about the senior management of Flying Eagle Gang.</p>
<p>After this incident, he knew that the above would never send anyone to help Su Xin get this justice.</p>
<p>A tumultuous, Su Xin below knocked on the table, and the crowd was immediately silent.</p>
<p>Although Su Xin only became their Old Boss, for more than a month, but the reward and punishment is clear, or let them very convinced.</p>
<p>But watching their side of the brother was killed by hostile gang faction stiff, the result is only in exchange for a face did not even see the apology and ten silver tael, which makes them all have a kind of rabbit dead fox sad feeling.</p>
<p>Although they have little to do with Su Xin, they still have resent qi in mind.</p>
<p>How can a Old Boss, who can&rsquo;t even keep his own subordinate convince them?</p>
<p>, Su Xin breathed a sigh of breath when he saw the scene.</p>
<p>This should be the scene that Flying Eagle Gang executives, or Master Third Tiger, wants to see, right?</p>
<p>Let yourself become an old boss who only has money, but the subordinate people are divorced from each other, so that you can be controlled by others?</p>
<p>Su Xin smiled coldly, knocked on the table, and said, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t matter if the top management doesn&rsquo;t send people. They have their concerns, but I Su Xin won&rsquo;t let my brother die in vain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time tomorrow, I will take Zhang Hong and Dai Chong&rsquo;s human head , to pay tribute to the dead Brother! &quot;</p>
<p>The whole Hall was silent.</p>
