  <h2>chapter19 Big things happen</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Su Xin and Li Huai carry their heads back to joyful forest, where Li Qing and others have been looking forward to.</p>
<p>Originally, Su Xin arranged for them to be break up, but Su Xin and Li Huai were too quick to do so. Before green bamboo gang&rsquo;s men and horses came, they brought back the heads of Dai Chong and Zhang Hong, and did not give them a chance to hunt them down at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss, are you ok?&rdquo; Li Qing asked in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do we look like something&rsquo;s wrong ? This is the head of Dai Chong and Zhang Hong. Carry it. &quot; Su Xin threw the package with the head to Li Qing.</p>
<p>The boy is still interesting, as soon as he met to ask the boss&rsquo;s safety, rather than asking whether the assassination was successful, this eyesight is good.</p>
<p>Li Qing trembled to take over the package, but the shock in his heart was beyond repertoire.</p>
<p>In fact, Su Xin didn&rsquo;t believe that he could succeed in assassinating Dai Chong.</p>
<p>At the beginning, he stood up, but the grievances in his heart could not be calmed down. He was unwilling to buy his brother&rsquo;s life by ten taels of silver.</p>
<p>When Su Xin said that he wanted Chen San to avenge himself, Li Qing swore in his heart that whether the trip was successful or not, his life would be handed over to Su Xin!</p>
<p>Unexpectedly now, Su Xin actually brought back the heads of Dai Chong and Zhang Hong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saner, you can finally close your eyes. We have found a good boss!&rdquo; Li Qing followed Su Xin silently with her head, but his eyes were red.</p>
<p>At this time in the happy forest, Huang Bingcheng anxiously in the hall to and fro in the circle, the eyes are dizzy.</p>
<p>With Suxin such a boss is indeed very prestigious, has money and  power.</p>
<p>But the boss of the same courage, can not generally large.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng is now in the habit of worrying every day, especially this time, in the event of an accident, their little happy forest will immediately fall apart.</p>
<p>Ji Gang is a cold-eyed look at the anxious people in the mouth, this assassination, whether successful or not, Su Xin is bound to die, and then see how you end up!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss, they&rsquo;re back!&rdquo; A crowd shouted to tell the news.</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng immediately did not wander, hurriedly trotted all the way, will Su Xin they welcome in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss, how is it?&rdquo; Huang asked in a hurry.</p>
<p>Li Qing put the package with the head on the table and opened it, and everyone present took a breath of cool air.</p>
<p>Dai Chong, the big leader of green bamboo Gang, is a person of the same level as the third master tiger. Most of them have seen him travel in a dignified way.</p>
<p>But now this person, actually by Su Xin cut off the head, put in front of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;he succeeded! He actually killed Dai Chong! Doesn&rsquo;t that mean he&rsquo;s already comparable to Third master tiger? &quot; Ji Gang has been so shocked that he is speechless.</p>
<p>He guessed that Su Xin could die on the spot or get away with it, but he couldn&rsquo;t guess how. Su Xin actually succeeded!</p>
<p>Ji just got soft on the chair and said nothing.</p>
<p>It was no longer possible for him to speculate that things had gone this far.</p>
<p>Now he just hopes that the flying eagle Gang senior management can trace it down, and don&rsquo;t involve him.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Ji Gang glared at Li Huai viciously, blaming this madman!</p>
<p>Ji Gang knew when he was under the third master tiger that Li Huai&rsquo;s nerves were a little abnormal, bloodthirsty and belligerent, and he often ignored the overall situation.</p>
<p>But who knows that he can go crazy to this extent, and ignore the secret order of Third Master tiger to assassinate Dai Chong with Suxin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;go and get some lime and fix up the head, and the rest of you will be gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huang Bingcheng small channel: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how to do with the Ji Gang, not to send people to continue to look after him??&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin shook his head, a smile on his face: &ldquo;No, he wants to say it, let him say it, and even if he doesn&rsquo;t say, Flying Eagle Gang&rsquo;s top management will know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin and Li Huai did not hide their appearance when they assassinated Dai Chong.</p>
<p>Although they all belong to that kind of nameless generation in Flying Eagle Gang, as long as they check it with their heart, they can find out immediately, and it is estimated that in less than half an hour, this matter will immediately spread throughout Changning House.</p>
<p>&ldquo;so what do we do now?&rdquo; Asked Huang Bingcheng.</p>
<p>&ldquo;sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;sleep?&rdquo; Huang Bingcheng froze at once.</p>
<p>Su Xin took it for granted: &ldquo;killing is a hard work, of course, we should have a good rest.&rdquo; It also gives Flying Eagle Gang executives some time to think about what to do with us, and tomorrow someone will take the initiative to look for us. &quot;</p>
<p>After hearing Su Xin&rsquo;s words, Huang Bingcheng was not in the mood to sleep, but more worried.</p>
<p>Just as before Lee adviser told them, and now the Flying Eagle Gang impossible with green bamboo gang war again.</p>
<p>The strength of the two groups is not much different, even if the war, but also wasted financial resources and manpower, can not get a trace of good.</p>
<p>But now Su Xin&rsquo;s assassination of Dai Chong has broken the balance between the two gangs. Huang Bing can imagine how angry the people of green bamboo Gang should be.</p>
<p>At that time, Su Xin will be the culprit of the war between the two factions. Their ending can be imagined.</p>
<p>Ignoring the worried Huang Bingcheng, Su Xin returned to his courtyard leisurely.</p>
<p>Xiner is practicing sword in the yard.</p>
<p>Su last letter to her by her little wooden sword actually dance very good, and the make out, it is the Great Sumeru Sword Style.</p>
<p>At the beginning, Xin&rsquo;er said she wanted to practice sword. Su Xin thought that she was just for fun, so she gave great Sumeru sword style to her casually. Unexpectedly, during this time, she was busy practicing. She even practiced very good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, my sister is a genius at learning swords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Xin&rsquo;s mouth is drawn. It can&rsquo;t be denied that Su Xin&rsquo;er is better than him in swordsmanship.</p>
<p>If he doesn&rsquo;t have the proficiency of 5% given by the system, I&rsquo;m afraid that he&rsquo;s not as proficient as xiner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother, you are back!&rdquo; Seeing Su Xin coming back, Xin&rsquo;er immediately jumped on it.</p>
<p>But then Xin&rsquo;er pushes away Su Xin, pinches her nose and looks disgusted: &ldquo;brother, what&rsquo;s your smell? It stinks. Go to the bath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just your little girl with a sharp nose.&rdquo; Suxin orders xiner&rsquo;s little head.</p>
<p>Just killed a man, his body is inevitably stained with blood, and then by the noon sun a move, there will be some light sour smell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, stop playing, too, and go to dinner after the shower.&rdquo; Su Xin pinched her little nose.</p>
<p>Xiner dissatisfied with Su Xin&rsquo;s hand down: &ldquo;I am not playing, when I practice swordplay, I can protect my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After taking a bath and eating, Suxin did not immediately rest, but recalled today&rsquo;s war.</p>
<p>In fact, this war is his first shot after martial arts practice, killing Liu Sandao that time, whether it is Chen Zhi or Liu Sandao, the strength is too weak, simply can not fully see their own strength.</p>
<p>This time, Dai Chong and Su Xin are neck and neck. Even in terms of combat experience, he is not as good as Dai Chong. If he had not relied on the strength of swords art&rsquo;s, he would not have won or lost with Dai Chong.</p>
<p>And he saw his shortcomings in the war.</p>
<p>Whether in a previous life or in this life, Su Xin has seen blood and killed people, although he was killed in the previous life.</p>
<p>He would not tremble at the sight of blood like those young people who are just starting out.</p>
<p>But also, he has only been in touch with martial arts for a month, and he can&rsquo;t be like those martial arts practitioners who have been practicing martial arts since childhood, who have been instructed by famous teachers to master martial arts.</p>
<p>Now Su Xin and people appear to be very stiff, on the one hand, the foundation is unstable, on the other hand, the lack of experience.</p>
<p>Jingwuming quick sword is the main attack, and great Sumeru sword style is the main defense.</p>
<p>Now Su Xin only knows these two skills, but still can&rsquo;t transform them naturally. Even if he doesn&rsquo;t use the weight sword now, he can&rsquo;t use the great Sumeru sword style at all.</p>
<p>All of this is due to the reason of sword skill proficiency, which is only 5%. This sword technology can only be reluctantly displayed in front of Suxin. It&rsquo;s impossible for Suxin to have a comprehensive understanding.</p>
<p>If you want to improve your proficiency, you have to go through penance. Of course, fighting is the best spiritual practice. After First battle, Su Xin&rsquo;s Great Sumeru Sword Style proficiency has been raised to 10%.</p>
<p>But this is also the problem, if only rely on penance to improve proficiency, it will take a lot of time.</p>
<p>The Great Sumeru Sword Style itself is only a star and a half, and it is destined to be eliminated in the future, so it is obviously not cost-effective to spend time on it.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, Su Xin hurriedly enters the system, ready to ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello host 01, welcome to the big villain system.&rdquo; The voice of indifference sounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would like to ask a question, can the proficiency of martial arts be improved only through penance and confrontation?</p>
<p>Now great Sumeru sword style is still useful to me, but if I go to study this martial art, it will be useless after my strength is improved? And the time I spent in my penance was a waste. &quot;</p>
<p>The system replied: &ldquo;the proficiency of martial arts can also be achieved through epiphany, and even some advanced martial arts can not be improved through asceticism after reaching a certain proficiency, but must rely on Epiphany.</p>
<p>As for the second point, the host falls into a misunderstanding. The proficiency of martial arts not only comes from the host&rsquo;s learning of new martial arts, but also from the host&rsquo;s understanding of martial arts.</p>
<p>If the host is a sword God like Ximen chuixue, he only needs to have a look at the great Sumeru sword style, so that he can bring its proficiency to the extreme, and even increase the level of the original one and a half star martial arts with a little thought.</p>
<p>So the host doesn&rsquo;t have to worry about wasting time after practicing Great Sumeru Sword Style, because you practice not only Great Sumeru Sword Style, but also kendo. &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as the system is finished, Su Xin understands that he is really in a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Martial arts is only a means, and their own martial arts is fundamental.</p>
<p>What I have to do is not to immerse myself in the great Sumeru sword style, but to understand the kendo.</p>
