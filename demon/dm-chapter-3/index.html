  <h2>chapter3 I am the demon lord of our village</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Chen Zhao looked at the metal box on the table. &ldquo;do you know that box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;which one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;the one on the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what box is there on the table except the lamp?&rdquo; Bezebub&rsquo;s face was completely at a loss.</p>
<p>Puzzled, Chen Zhao looked at Beelzebub. &ldquo;are you sure you didn&rsquo;t see anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human, there&rsquo;s nothing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He or it, really can&rsquo;t see anything.</p>
<p>Is this the metal box?</p>
<p>Chen Zhao was not so sure and went forward to pick up the metal box.</p>
<p>But to Beelzebub, Chen Zhao was just holding the air.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao opened the metal box and found one more in it.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao is pretty sure that until then, the metal box was empty.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao took out his beads, and Beelzebub immediately screamed, &ldquo;Demon crystals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what? Demon crystallization? &quot; Chen Zhao is even more puzzled about how this demon crystal is here.</p>
<p>And what is this demon crystal for?</p>
<p>Bezebub, on the other hand, seemed very nervous about the demon crystallization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;give it to me!&rdquo; Bezebub suddenly pounced on Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>But Chen Zhao raised his foot and kicked Besib straight out. The bastard&rsquo;s little demon was not much different from an ordinary Shapi dog, except for his eccentric abilities.</p>
<p>And since he&rsquo;s so nervous about the demon crystal, it means it&rsquo;s a good thing.</p>
<p>When Chen Zhao put the demon crystals back in the metal box, Bezebub immediately shouted, &ldquo;where have you hidden the demon crystals?&rdquo; Give me the devil, and I can give you any wish. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trust you to have a ghost, Chen Zhao thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;tell me first what a demon crystal is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;something to extend your life.&rdquo; Said Bezebub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;do you demons suffer from longevity, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;of course, with the exception of the previous demon, a little demon like us is two hundred years old at the most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what about the evil lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well. I am the devil lord. I am the devil lord of our village. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao was in a trance, but when he thought about it, he knew how he could really summon some great demon if he was so weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;so how long can such a demon crystal increase your lifespan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;only one year? So little? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;otherwise, you think, then a small one, can have a year is good, give me that demon crystal, I am already dying, if there is no demon crystal, perhaps I will die soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;tell me the truth, how old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;how old are you? I ask you to tell the truth.&rdquo; Chen Zhao said in a tone of command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s change the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;are you going to refuse my order?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m thirty years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what? You&rsquo;re only thirty? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;is it strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;if you were of human age, you would be underage now, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We demons are different. We know a lot of things from birth, and our bodies grow faster. In a few months, we can fully mature. I forgot to say that I am already the father of fifteen children. My wife has just given birth to a litter for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you demons have children in nests?</p>
<p>Knock-</p>
<p>&ldquo;who?&rdquo; Asked Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police, please open the door.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a woman&rsquo;s voice out there.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao was not credulous, and when she arrived, her mother told herself that even if someone claimed to be a policeman, she had to see the ID first.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao slightly opened a crack in the door, with a bolt hanging on it, and saw a woman in plain clothes with her ID card in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what can I do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;there was a robbery downstairs. Can I ask you a few questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;robbery? You don&rsquo;t suspect I did it, do you? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt you, in fact, the innkeeper said just now, thanks to the fact that you asked him to deliver the food to your room, otherwise he would have met the gangster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao breathed a sigh of relief when he heard this.</p>
<p>After all, he is new here, and he still doesn&rsquo;t want to stir up too much right and wrong.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao opened the door. &ldquo;do you need to come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policewoman came in and looked at the room. &ldquo;is this your dog?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Woof-woof-</p>
<p>&ldquo;can I bite this human?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bezebub barked for a while, but oddly enough, Chen Zhao heard human words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a sick mad dog. I&rsquo;d better not go near it. I&rsquo;m going to give me a few injections these days and get a pet card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;all right.&rdquo; When the policewoman heard Chen Zhao&rsquo;s words, she actually had a better impression of Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>After all, to be able to pick up a dog should be a loving person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;you were in your room twenty minutes ago, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;did you hear anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;have you seen anything suspicious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well. I was in the room. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, did you look out the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, if you think of anything later, you can contact the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;can I have your phone number, please?&rdquo; Chen Zhao asked shamelessly.</p>
<p>The policewoman smiled. &ldquo;of course, but I don&rsquo;t have much time. If you want to invite me to dinner, you&rsquo;d better make an appointment in advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The policewoman is not the very beautiful woman in the American TV show, and the skeleton is a little big, but she is in good shape.</p>
<p>From Chen Zhao&rsquo;s point of view, there is at least D +.</p>
<p>&ldquo;this is my number. I&rsquo;ll be in touch when I&rsquo;m free. Bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;good-bye, Glenn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner had Glenn&rsquo;s forefoot left than Ethan&rsquo;s hind foot came up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave it to you, Chen, and your pet.&rdquo; Ethan took a lot of food and drink, drinks, several hamburgers, and barbecue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethan, I heard, but I didn&rsquo;t do anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, although you did not mean to, but I believe that it must be the will of God, please accept a little of my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t bother you. I wish you a sweet dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Woof-woof-</p>
<p>Beelzebub cried out there, &ldquo;your uncle&rsquo;s God is clearly the work of this uncle. Why should it be attributed to God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You fat human, go to hell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;does this little guy like me so much?&rdquo; Ethan smiled when he heard Beelzebub&rsquo;s dog bark.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao rolled his eyes. Which eye did you see that he liked you?</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s asking you to die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, little devil, don&rsquo;t disturb the other guests, and be honest with me.&rdquo; Chen Zhao took a picture of Bezebub.
