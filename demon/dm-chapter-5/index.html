  <h2>chapter5 First customer</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>If you want to get a medical license, you need to be familiar with the medical laws and rules on this side of the United States, which is equivalent to a new college entrance examination, which means that, Chen Zhao will not have a stable source of income for a long time to come.</p>
<p>And their own money, certainly not enough to last that long.</p>
<p>So on second thought, Chen Zhao decided to take Ethan&rsquo;s advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen, since you accept my suggestion, then I also have some rules to explain to you in advance. I am only responsible for acting as an intermediary and taking a 20% cut. Of course, only the customers I recommend will be paid. If it is a customer that you develop yourself, then it has nothing to do with me, and some special clients, you can choose to refuse, and between you and the patient, it can only be a medical relationship, and it must not go beyond the scope of this relationship. There is some sex once in a while. The relationship doesn&rsquo;t matter, as long as you don&rsquo;t have emotional disputes, and you must not disclose information about the patient, especially privacy or defects, even I can&rsquo;t say, it&rsquo;s for you, for me, for the client, for all three. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;in addition, every customer must be a cash transaction, and there must be no record of money transfer. Otherwise, the Inland Revenue Department will be able to find you. It must pay first and then see a doctor, because some customers, their financial situation is unstable, perhaps by the time you recover the debt, he has already died in a certain corner. In addition, if the customer asks you to sign some medical certificate, never sign it, no amount of money can be signed. Do you understand? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot, I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;as for your safety, you can rest assured, even if you give some black. To help the boss see a doctor, even in the process of seeing things that should not be seen, no one will touch you, this is the rule of the industry, after all, if they dare to touch you, then no one will treat them, you can rest assured. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethan, are you familiar with the industry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been in touch with a doctor, but I&rsquo;ve worked as an intermediary, and the rules are the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Ethan and Chen Zhao have reached an agreement, they will also not leave a written contract, but will only use oral form as a guarantee of the contract.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao goes back to his room, Besib grabs a hamburger and eats it, and it&rsquo;s in the sun in front of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beelzebub, are you demons not afraid of the sun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;stupid human, I&rsquo;m not a vampire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;do vampires really exist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;if demons exist, why don&rsquo;t vampires exist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;on earth or in hell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell, there must be no such thing as hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;vampires are actually branches of demons. No demons have come to earth in the last thousand years. The vampire subspecies that have been left behind must be dead. How can there be vampires?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what subspecies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it has vampire characteristics, but it can&rsquo;t reproduce. It&rsquo;s called a subspecies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao is purely curious: &ldquo;aren&rsquo;t vampires immortal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;how can it be immortal? there is no real immortal creature in this world, demons, gods, vampires, and most vampires have a lifespan of 500 years, and they can&rsquo;t prolong their lives through demon crystallization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;how do vampires breed? Is it just a bite and you become a vampire? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;how is it possible that purebred vampires are bred through normal bisexual reproduction, no different from the breeding of humans and other demons, and subspecies require very special rituals to complete the transformation, but I&rsquo;m not a vampire, so I don&rsquo;t know the process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beelzebub, do you not want to go back to hell for the sake of the devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, will you give it to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao thought about it. Besib was of great help yesterday, so he didn&rsquo;t mind giving him the demon crystal.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao opened the metal box, but there was another demon crystal in it, which was much bigger than the previous one.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s going on? Why are there two?</p>
<p>Does this box produce demonic crystals?</p>
<p>No, there must be a special reason.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao looked back on what happened yesterday and had some guesses in his heart.</p>
<p>Is it because of saving people?</p>
<p>The first demon crystallized because he asked Ethan to deliver food, so he brushed past the robber and avoided the danger.</p>
<p>The second demon crystallization is because you saved the girl?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beelzebub, how long will this demon crystal increase its lifespan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bezebub immediately became a real Shapi dog, pouncing in front of Chen Zhao, sticking out his tongue, and the dog&rsquo;s head was covered with Xiyi&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;at least five years, how many demons do you have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s none of your business. Take it. Now, go back to hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wang-</p>
<p>Bezebub took the devil crystal in one mouthful, and then the body slowly disappeared.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao holds the little demon crystal. I don&rsquo;t know if humans are useful.</p>
<p>I forgot. I should have asked Beelzebub how to use this thing.</p>
<p>Then, Chen Zhao&rsquo;s phone rang. &ldquo;Chen, do you have a minute? I&rsquo;ll get you a list for three hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;m in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;send me the address on my phone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;the address has been sent. If you don&rsquo;t know the place, you can call Vincent. He&rsquo;s been driving a taxi for ten years. He knows Los Angeles very well. You have his number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao dialed Vincent, and Vincent readily agreed.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t long before, Chen Zhao got into Vincent&rsquo;s car.</p>
<p>Vincent circled left and right for twenty minutes and was already there.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao rolled down the window and said, &ldquo;is this it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In front of him was a villa obscured by palm trees, with iron doors at the door.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao went to the iron gate and said to the guard at the door, &ldquo;Hey, man, I&rsquo;m a doctor. I have an appointment with Mr. Dale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;just a moment.&rdquo; The guard took out his walkie-talkie and released it after confirming the identity of Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>From afar I heard loud music and the joyful voices of men and women.</p>
<p>When I got to a swimming pool, I saw men and women by the pool, wearing swimming trunks and bikinis, playing in the water or on the shore.</p>
<p>Into the villa, there are also many men and women flirting, and even in the corner of the piston movement.</p>
<p>Led by the guards, Chen Zhao pushed open the door of a bedroom.</p>
<p>Inside was a pair of men and women, and the woman was a blonde, sitting at the window with a glass and a cigarette in the other hand.</p>
<p>The woman wore only one bra and showed her hot figure.</p>
<p>The man sat with his head down by the bed, feeling a little depressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boss, this is the doctor you hired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;is there a problem?&rdquo; Chen Zhao, put down the equipment box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, take a look at it for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what&rsquo;s your problem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man lifted the bath towel around his lower body and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get hard.&rdquo; Ps: bookfriends, I am Hanbao, recommend a free novel App, support novel download, listen to books, zero advertising, a variety of reading modes.
