  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Knock-</p>
<p>At night, Chen Zhao heard a quick knock at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what time is it?&rdquo; Chen Zhao opened his eyes in a daze and saw that it was still dark outside the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen, did you hear that? I&rsquo;m Ethan. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao smeared up and kicked something under his feet.</p>
<p>Wang-</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, you stepped on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you gone back to hell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go back yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignoring Beelzebub, Chen Zhao went to open the door and said, &ldquo;what can I do for Ethan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen, I heard Vincent say that you are a doctor, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it used to be, but it&rsquo;s not anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;something has happened to a tenant. Can you go and have a look? I don&rsquo;t want him to die in my hotel. &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao rubbed his forehead. &ldquo;did you call an ambulance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;the nearest hospital is half an hour away. In half an hour, it should be able to be taken to the morgue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t have a license to practice medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, I know the rules. I won&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo; Ethan took some ten dollars out of his pocket and said, &ldquo;think of it as your consultation money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;just a moment. Let me get my tools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time abroad, Chen Zhao has brought all his possessions, most of which are medical equipment.</p>
<p>But shipping was more expensive than the medical devices themselves., Chen Zhao was distressed for a long time.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao used to work in the emergency room, but then the emergency room was really not a place to stay, so he transferred to the surgical department, which was more stressful than the emergency room.</p>
<p>After a corner and three rooms, Ethan pushed the door and led Chen Zhao in.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao saw a young woman lying on the ground twitching slightly, with white powder scattered on the table next to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;she smokes.. Eat too much poison. Have you tasted it? &quot; Asked Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao immediately checked the pulse, pupil and heart rate.</p>
<p>Heart rate is low, hypotension, pupil contraction, lips purple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have naloxone.&rdquo; Chen Zhao looked dignified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;is there a way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;does it take half an hour for the fastest ambulance to arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it.&rdquo; Ethan said helplessly, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s only sixteen. I hope she&rsquo;ll make it. Do your best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao thought for a moment that the girl was inhaling.. Toxic, that is to say, if it can make her vomit at this time, it can indeed alleviate and relieve the symptoms of poisoning, or at least keep her going for at least half an hour.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao took out a set of silver needles and stabbed them in Qimen, Tiandu and Lingtai respectively.</p>
<p>This acupuncture was learned from an acquaintance of my father, but I haven&rsquo;t seen him since his death.</p>
<p>These three acupoints link to the stomach at the same time, can play the role of vomiting.</p>
<p>However, after waiting for a minute, the woman did not respond.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao&rsquo;s face changed slightly, opened the girl&rsquo;s clothes, and touched the girl&rsquo;s abdomen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;on an empty stomach, Ethan, do you know how long it&rsquo;s been since she ate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;she doesn&rsquo;t seem to have been out these two days. She asked me to deliver food last night. I haven&rsquo;t ordered it today. Is there a problem?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suck. Poisoned people are already weak, and coupled with fasting state, they are more likely to be poisoned.</p>
<p>Because of the poison. When inhaled into the body, the product cannot be diluted by food, which is the deadliest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;something must be stuffed into her stomach before she can spit out the poison and the food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;go and get some food.&rdquo; Chen Zhao said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;do you have a way to get her to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;give it a try. If you don&rsquo;t try, she won&rsquo;t last half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Ethan left, Chen Zhao said to Beelzebub, &ldquo;use your power to make her eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suck. Poisonous people have no appetite because of poison. Products affect people&rsquo;s physiological functions, allowing the body to make wrong judgments.</p>
<p>And long-term inhalation. Poisoned people are likely to cause permanent damage to the body. So you mustn&rsquo;t smoke it. Poison, no reason, no excuse. )</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, the girl is still in a coma, normal feeding and feeding is difficult to play a role.</p>
<p>But her consciousness is still there, and it&rsquo;s a survival instinct.</p>
<p>But, Chen Zhao felt hungry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it, why are you using your powers on me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you&rsquo;re in this range, and I can&rsquo;t control it so accurately, so you&rsquo;ve been affected, too. Next time, stay away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;here comes the food.&rdquo; Ethan moved so fast that he came with a lot of food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meat is no good. Bread, coke, put it in her mouth. Do you have chopsticks? forget it.&rdquo; Chen Zhao put his finger directly into the girl&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>Meat can cause swallowing blockage without chewing and should never be forced to eat with meat when in a coma.</p>
<p>&ldquo;is that all right?&rdquo; Ethan was a little worried when he saw Chen Zhao stuffing food in such a rude way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;in the absence of drugs and corresponding first aid equipment, this is the only way, or watch her die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Chen Zhao saw a shadow rise from the maiden.</p>
<p>Soul!?</p>
<p>&ldquo;go back!&rdquo; Chen Zhao shouted loudly, and the shadow was startled and lay down again.</p>
<p>The next moment, the girl&rsquo;s body whipped violently, and then followed by a sound of wow, vomiting wildly.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao and Ethan looked at each other and both breathed a long sigh of breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;tell her to eat, and when the ambulance arrives, take her to the hospital and check again.&rdquo; Chen Zhao packed up and got up to leave.</p>
<p>The situation of this young girl is very common in this country.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao is just an outsider, so he has no intention of becoming a fighter and poison of justice. To fight.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, I do not intend to incarnate the people&rsquo;s teacher and educate the young girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;thanks for the hard work, Chen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao looked at the girl, shook his head, abandoned the equipment box and left.</p>
<p>, Chen Zhao slept until noon and got up stretched out.</p>
<p>After washing, each person and a dog went out to look for food.</p>
<p>When the motel is a hundred metres out of the road, there is a hamburger shop.</p>
<p>After Chen Zhao and Beelzebub had enough to eat and drink, they came back with a strong stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen, are you up?&rdquo; At the counter, Ethan sat playing with his cell phone and said hello when he saw Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;good morning. No, good afternoon. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chen, do you have a business card?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business card? No, you want my card? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not that I want it, but I think you need a business card.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;if you&rsquo;re going to be a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even have a license to practice medicine right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, be a supernumerary doctor, believe me, don&rsquo;t get a medical license, because you can&rsquo;t do it, you just got to the United States, you can&rsquo;t get a medical license, I can introduce you to a few clients, and I&rsquo;m a cash-paying client, so I can make sure you don&rsquo;t get found out, and of course, I&rsquo;m going to take a commission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;is there any danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethan&rsquo;s suggestion made Chen Zhao hesitant. He knew that it was difficult to get a medical license in the United States, not to mention that his diploma was a domestic diploma, which the United States might not recognize.</p>
<p>Ethan&rsquo;s suggestion, directly let him give up taking the formal channel, but to do a quack visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, the client I introduced to you will certainly not report you to the police or other government departments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I mean, is your client safe? I don&rsquo;t want to be a health consultant for the mafia. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any mafia, maybe some people are involved in the dark, but don&rsquo;t worry, the clients I introduce to you will ensure your safety in the first place.&rdquo; Ps: bookfriends, I am Hanbao, recommend a free novel App, support novel download, listen to books, zero advertising, a variety of reading modes.
