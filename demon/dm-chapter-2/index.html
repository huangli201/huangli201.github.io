  <h2>chapter2 This Shapi is a demon?</h2>
  <div class="rounded">
    <p>Chen Zhao mentioned Shapi Dog: &ldquo;it is said that a small number of people will have auditory hallucinations after flying, it should be my auditory hallucinations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, you are insulting a hell lord. Do you understand what this means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;do you know more than a hundred ways for Chinese to cook dog meat?&rdquo; Chen Zhao is not a pussy at all, mainly because his brain has not turned the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, you can&rsquo;t do this. You summoned me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I summoned? Did I summon you? &quot; Chen Zhao slowly put down the Shapi dog, who called himself the lord of hell, and his mind was a little messy, no, very messy, to be exact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am subordinate to the king of gluttony, Bezebub. Vito. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;how did I summon you?&rdquo; Asked Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;how do I know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it supposed to be a sacrifice or something to summon demons? What ceremony did I have just now? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, but I felt your sign, so I came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;so what can you do for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say what you need me to do for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao did not understand how Bezebub appeared.</p>
<p>But now he wanted to figure out what was the use of summoning the talking Shapi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want money. A lot of money.&rdquo; Chen Zhao made a very vulgar request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, I am subordinate to the king of gluttony, not to Marmon, the king of greed. I do not do such vulgar things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;so how do I summon Marmen&rsquo;s subordinates?&rdquo; Chen Zhao is now interested in the issue again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know why I was summoned by you. Do you think I might know when you ask me how to summon the subordinates of the other demons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;so how do I send you back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food, I want to eat, to satisfy my desires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao called room service: &ldquo;Ethan, get me something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not long after, Ethan brought the food, a few homemade hamburgers: &ldquo;Ten dollars, thank you for your patronage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when Ethan saw the Shapi dog Bezib, he said, &ldquo;my hotel is not allowed to have pets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find a place to bury it later, and then I&rsquo;ll call the Animal Protection Society and tell them you killed a pet dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;well, I&rsquo;m kidding.&rdquo; Ethan is a bully and a hard Yankee.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>&ldquo;you should be nice to me. I&rsquo;m your summoning demon. There&rsquo;s a contract between you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it suddenly occurred to me that if I killed you, I might be able to replace it with a more useful demon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you will be punished, you evil human.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;all right, eat up and go back to hell, or I can&rsquo;t help making you into a dog hot pot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human food is the only place I miss the world.&rdquo; Bezebub ate a hamburger in one bite: &ldquo;unfortunately, my body is too small, two is the limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;do demons have such a small appetite?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s just that my projection can only appear in this form, damn it, can you be stronger the next time you summon me? Let me have a bigger body. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;does this have anything to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;of course, the more powerful you are, the greater your body will summon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be thankful for my weakness, or I&rsquo;m afraid my fortune won&rsquo;t satisfy your appetite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;then I&rsquo;ll see you next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll never see you again.&rdquo; Chen Zhao made no secret of his disgust.</p>
<p>Bezebub slowly disappeared, right in front of Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao also filled some belly, and he was hungry, too.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Chen Zhao recalled that before Beelzebub appeared, he saw the food in Ethan&rsquo;s hands and developed an appetite.</p>
<p>Then the next moment, Beelzebub appeared, could that be the reason?</p>
<p>&ldquo;appetite?&rdquo; Chen Zhao looked at the hamburger on the table, but his mind was full.</p>
<p>Gudong-</p>
<p>The familiar little body appeared again, and Bezebub looked sadly at Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;said he would never see him again? Why are you calling me again? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just trying. There&rsquo;s a hamburger on the table. Get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat. I haven&rsquo;t digested what I just ate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;it&rsquo;s troublesome. I need to try to summon other demons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;if you allow me to use my abilities, I can speed up digestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gollum-</p>
<p>Just then, Chen Zhao suddenly felt very hungry, very hungry. This feeling is ten times stronger than just now.</p>
<p>Chen Zhao immediately picked up a hamburger and gobbled it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;still hungry. Strange. What&rsquo;s going on? &quot;</p>
<p>Chen Zhao looked violently at Beelzebub. &ldquo;did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you promised me to use my powers.&rdquo; Bezebub shrank his eyes and seemed a little afraid of Chen Zhao.</p>
<p>&ldquo;that&rsquo;s a good waste.&rdquo; Chen Zhao curled his mouth. &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not practical at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;if the projection you summon is strong enough, I can hold a man to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a doctor, not a killer. My job is to save people, not to kill. And. All you can do is make me eat an extra hamburger. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you are too weak, you pathetic human being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like I can have another hot pot of dog meat now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man, we have a contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;and then what? What happens to me if I eat you? Dead? Or become a demon? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you. You will. &quot; Bezebub was a little bewildered: &ldquo;when I get back, I&rsquo;ll check the Devil&rsquo;s Book and tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not a demon who doesn&rsquo;t do his homework.</p>
<p>&ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen, so you won&rsquo;t dare to kill me, human.&rdquo; Bezebub has a knack for speculating about human nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;in the same way, you are at my disposal now, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t have to expect me to help you with some impossible wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;come on, roll three times on the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Human, are you challenging the dignity of a demon lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;what kind of punishment will you be punished for disobeying the order of the summoner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One lap, two laps, three laps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;good dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a dog, I&rsquo;m a demon! You despicable human being. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;three more laps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One lap, two laps, three laps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;the second wave is a pussy? I thought the devil would be a little more determined. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;as a matter of fact, it is not. In essence, there is no difference between our ideas and our ideas.&rdquo; &ldquo;if we put aside the differences in species, our biggest difference is that we demons are more rational than you humans,&rdquo; Bezebub said. &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;do you still know the concept of species?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;many of you are in hell, and it should be said that most of you are in hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;so hell should be more developed than the world? After all, there are a lot of geniuses in hell, and after they die once, they won&rsquo;t die again, will they? &quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;as a matter of fact, when their souls go to hell, they will only remember a few things, and the longer they go to hell, the less memory they will have, so we can only know the general situation of the world from their mouths. But it is obviously impossible to rely on those human geniuses to develop hell, not to mention that we demons are more enthusiastic about destruction than creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;are there many people in the world who can summon demons as much as I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;in fact, no, I may have been the only demon to leave hell by summoning for the last thousand years.&rdquo; Ps: bookfriends, I am Hanbao, recommend a free novel App, support novel download, listen to books, zero advertising, a variety of reading modes.
